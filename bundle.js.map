Such cooperation will involve not only human beings, groups and\\nassociations but also a growing multitude of increasingly independent\\nartificial agents.</p>\\n<p>Every blockchain creates a social network around its applications, with network value growing exponentially with the number of participants in accordance with Reed’s Law. This value isn’t extracted by intermediaries or controllers, as with previous centralized models. Instead, it’s shared among participants, providing economic incentives for cooperation without coercion.</p>\\n<p>Not all blockchains are created equal. There are three key characteristics that make scalable blockchain-enabled cooperation possible: openness, neutrality and immutability.</p>\\n<p><strong>Openness is necessary</strong>. It goes without saying that the rules of the game should be open for anyone to see and understand. Anyone should be able to participate in any layer of the system without asking for any permission whatsoever. Anyone should be able to use the network in accordance with its rules. Anyone should be able to create their own client implementing the open protocol. Anyone should be able to contribute to network security, and so on. No registration, identification or other preconditions should limit participation. All such limitations prevent the network from scaling and their enforcement creates centralization risks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Neutrality is necessary</strong>. It’s important for anyone participating in\\nblockchain-enabled cooperation to be on an equal footing with everyone else. It doesn’t matter if you wield huge economic power or only a tiny amount. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a saintly Mother Theresa or a vicious drug dealer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a human or a refrigerator. It doesn’t matter what you believe in, what political theory you subscribe to, or whether you’re a moral or immoral person. A participant’s ethnicity, age, sex, profession, social standing, friends or affiliations, make or model, goals, purposes or intentions — none of this matters to the blockchain even a bit. The rules of the game are exactly the same for everyone, period. Without neutrality, the system is skewed towards one set of participants at the expense of others. In that case, it’s less likely to gain universal acceptance and maximize network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p><strong>Immutability is necessary</strong>. The blockchain is a truth machine preserving one universally accepted version of history, one immutable sequence of events. What’s true once is always true, regardless of political or business interests, and no amount of lobbying can change that. If it’s simply not possible to change history, then no resources are wasted on the effort. If there are any loopholes at all, then sufficiently motivated and determined interest groups will exploit them at the expense of others, diminishing network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p>The rules governing the blockchain network are known in advance. They’re exactly the same for everyone and not subject to change other than with 100% consensus. Yes, it must be 100%. Because any change to the system’s rules that not all participants freely agree to creates a network split, diminishing network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p>It’s impossible to achieve these blockchain characteristics without the system\\nbeing <strong>truly decentralized</strong>. If any aspect of the blockchain system becomes\\nsubject to centralized control, this introduces an attack vector enabling the\\nviolation of one or more of the key blockchain characteristics. It may be\\npossible to limit participation (such as by enforcing AML/KYC rules), thus\\nviolating openness. It may be possible to enforce discriminatory policies (such as by filtering “illegal” transactions), thus violating neutrality. It may be possible to rewrite the history of events (such as by confiscating or\\n“redistributing” funds), thus violating immutability. Introducing centralized\\nchokepoints creates a precondition for the introduction of “blockchain\\nintermediaries or controllers” who can siphon value out of the system at other participants’ expense.</p>\\n<p>So decentralization is the most important feature of blockchain systems, the one everything else depends on. With decentralization, blockchains will come to rule the world. Without it, they’ll be “contained” and railroaded into niche applications.</p>\\n<p><strong>We decentralists</strong> are committed to keeping blockchains open, neutral and\\nimmutable. We’re committed to keeping blockchain systems decentralized. This informs all our actions and positions towards any developments in the crypto world and beyond. All attempts to violate any of the key blockchain\\ncharacteristics should be fought. All changes to a blockchain’s rules that\\nintroduce new centralization risks or strengthen existing ones should be fought. Only developments that are clearly beneficial to decentralization or strengthen the three key blockchain characteristics should be supported and encouraged.\\nThe blockchain revolution won’t be centralized. Let’s make sure of it.</p>\\n<p><strong>Onward.</strong></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 401 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Let's keep the original censorship-resistant Ethereum going!\",\"date\":\"2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Arvicco\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nIUazw_u3KChCX89fLgLDg.png\\\" alt=\\\"Ethereum Classic Logo\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Ideology</h2>\\n<p>We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can’t shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone.</p>\\n<p>More: <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede\\\">https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede</a></p>\\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\\n<p>Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (diligently hidden, pro-fork) coin vote on <a href=\\\"http://carbonvote.com/\\\">Carbonvote</a>, 19% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners voted against the previous ‘DAO softfork’ and would logically oppose hardfork as well. Such a significant minority of stakeholders should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a clear choice.</p>\\n<p>If we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized applications that are actually censorship resistant.</p>\\n<p>More: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic/freeworldcomputer-project\\\">https://github.com/ethereumclassic/freeworldcomputer-project</a></p>\\n<h2>Goals</h2>\\n<p>The main goal of the project is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.</p>\\n<h2>Plan</h2>\\n<h3>Development</h3>\\n<p>We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients.

We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.</p>\\n<p>Fun fact. If you keep ETH under your direct control (not in a 3rd party wallet or exchange account), you will have <strong>two</strong> sets of coins instead of one post-fork. You could then install a forked Ethereum client in addition to Ethereum Classic, copy your private keys there and use your coins on both chains! You won’t be so lucky if your ETH are locked with 3rd party going into the fork - some exchanges <a href=\\\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sy7w6/breaking_kraken_on_the_july_20th_ethereum/\\\">already announced</a> that they will only return one type of coin post-fork to its users.</p>\\n<h3>Miners</h3>\\n<p>Miners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic\\\">https://github.com/ethereumclassic</a>.</p>\\n<p>The difficulty of the original chain will be quite high post-fork, but it will adjust to actual hashrate shortly (just 2048 blocks, a few hours). Since it is expected that most hashrate will move to hardfoked chain, post-adjustment it will be possible to obtain decent mining rewards in classic ethers even with solo mining.</p>\\n<p>Mining pool supporting the original chain is currently under development, please check here in a couple of days.</p>\\n<h3>Traders</h3>\\n<p>Most important question for traders is ‘will ETC have market price’? There are all reasons to believe that it will. Essentially, ETC is an Ethereum <a href=\\\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0\\\">‘spinoff coin’</a> with a wide user base of all current ETH users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won’t. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. Additional reasoning why <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5dawgg\\\">ETC is very unlikely to be ‘worthless’</a>.</p>\\n<p>One exchange agreed to carry ETC already. It’s Bitsquare which is planning to <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5e1oo7\\\">add ETC trading right after the fork</a>. Other trading venues will follow. We are in talks with several exchanges to add ETC to their platforms (or re-introduce trading for the exchanges that previously traded ethers).</p>\\n<h4>Let’s make sure original Ethereum vision doesn’t just “go gentle into that good night”!</h4>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 402 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"ETC - new Ethereum Classic ticker symbol\",\"date\":\"2016-07-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Arvicco\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Logo_ETC_TV_2015.png\\\" alt=\\\"ETC\\\"></p>\\n<p>Now that we moved through the most difficult part of the post-fork transition and ensured our chain survival, we may focus on other things. Like branding, for example. Some people have noticed that I’ve started to use ETC ticker for Ethereum Classic instead of ETH-C. Why? Here is the rationale.</p>\\n<p>ETH-C ticker served us well in the process of HF transition. When we tried to explain the difference between pre-forked and post-forked tokens to the community, we could say that legacy ETH ‘splits’ into two separate tokens, namely ETH-F and ETH-C. It was logically consistent and helped us to convey our idea.</p>\\n<p>After the transition happened, there is a problem with this narrative however: ‘ETH-F’ does not really exist. All the exchanges assigned ‘ETH’ ticker to the forked Ethereum, even if many people consider it incorrect, with the original Ethereum chain still <a href=\\\"https://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4ts1w4/hard_fork_went_smoothly_ethereum_classic_chain_is/\\\">very much alive</a>. So, ‘ETH-F’ just isn’t real. And so is ‘ETH-C’.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>In crypto-trading world, a four-letter ticker conveys inferiority, like a second-class citizen. We don’t want our ticker to be seen similar to some shitty 2nd rate altcoins.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We don’t want to be second rate. Ethereum Classic has all the necessary components and a clear potential to grow into a major smart contract execution platform that is used by many types of dapps that critically depend on censorship-resistance. Dapps that are neither comfortable nor welcome on the forked blockchain, “mutable by democratic consensus”. And we want our ticker to reflect this ambition early on.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Three-letter codes are entrenched standard in forex/currency world. Most of the forex infrastructure is tied to these restrictions.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ah, yes, standards. ISO 4217 Currency Codes only allows for 3-letter codes. Only major crypto-currencies that follow this convention will be acceptable to wider financial system down the road. All the rest would have to change their ticker mid-way.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Even in crypto-trading, some of the tools, trackers and exchanges don’t even support non-standard 4 letter codes. You can see BTC, LTC, ETH, but not DOGE, BTCD or USDT there.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>ETC (<strong>ET</strong>hereum <strong>C</strong>lassic) contrasts well to ETH ticker which is claimed by the forked chain, without looking second-rate to it. At the same time, this ticker has ‘a look and feel’ of important coins such as BTC, LTC… ETC?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The ticker ETC is miraculously not yet claimed by other cryptos. Which is very fortunate.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This are the main points supporting a view that transition to <strong>ETC</strong> as a main ticker for Ethereum Classic is a very good idea. Of course, you are free to use ETH-C in a narrative that contrasts it with a forked ETH-F or any other way. But for the obvious reasons given above (and some less obvious), ETC makes so much more sense as a main/trading ticker for Ethereum Classic.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 403 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"ETC exchange trading and other news\",\"date\":\"2016-07-24T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Arvicco\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Logo_ETC_TV_2015.png\\\" alt=\\\"ETC\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>News update</strong></p>\\n<p>Ethereum Classic is starting to make some serious waves.

As each individual is motivated to propose organizational improvements, for each opportunity the organization has, several proposals might be sent for evaluation of the decision taking board. It’s probable that not all the proposals made are going to be funded because resources (matter, time, space, intelligent agents) are limited. So methods for selecting most fit proposals are often utilized. Here I present a method analogous to the genetic algorithm for selecting most fit proposals to be funded within an anarchist organization.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://miletrackgps.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dna.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 2 - Source <a href=\\\"https://miletrackgps.com/\\\">Mile Track GPS</a></p>\\n<h1>Proposed Algorithm</h1>\\n<p>A population of proposals to a problem is evolved toward better proposals. The evolution starts from a population of community generated proposals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a generation of proposals. In each generation, the fitness of every proposal in the population is evaluated; The more fit proposals are selected from the current population, and each proposal details are modified to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate proposals is then used in the next iteration of the proposals algorithm. Commonly, the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.</p>\\n<h1>Measuring Fitness Of Each Proposal</h1>\\n<p>One way to effectively measure the fitness of proposals is by a simple democracy voting process. The problem with this method is that receiving bad votes can lead to the tiranny of the majority.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://t1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/48/00/52/400_F_48005278_ll3uog4WdeW3maZ11URbnw3wXBsr9xUl.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 3 - Source <a href=\\\"http://t1.ftcdn.net/\\\">FTCDN</a></p>\\n<p>If somehow a method for measuring the quality of the votes was available, the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority\\\">tiranny of the majority</a> could be avoided.</p>\\n<h1>Measuring Quality of Votes</h1>\\n<p>The quality of the votes can be estimated with the conscience level each voter has.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.mytechanalyst.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CustomerSatChecklist-Depositphotos_4351613_xs.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 4 - Source <a href=\\\"http://www.mytechanalyst.net/\\\">My Tech Analyst</a></p>\\n<p>To better illustrate the conscience level parameter I’ll give a classical example called <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\\\">tragedy of the commons</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Tragedy of the Commons</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/I6EL2xy.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nFigure 5 - Source <a href=\\\"http://www.jborden.com/\\\">Jborden</a></p>\\n<p>People with less conscience would vote based on their own interest resulting in the depleting of the common resource whereas people with more conscience would actually vote for the collective handling of the common resource for added overall productivity.</p>\\n<p>If each individual has one vote, and 80% of the individuals are not conscious, full democracy would probably lead to depleting that resource. Let’s then imagine a system that will give 5 votes for each individual that passes the courses called Tragedy Of The Commons and Correct Handling Of The Common Resource.</p>\\n<h2>Star Wars Analogy</h2>\\n<p>In Star Wars the consciousness level would be something like the <a href=\\\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian\\\">Midichlorian count</a>. The highest Midichlorian count is attributed in the series to <a href=\\\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker\\\">Anakin Skywalker</a>, above 20,000.</p>\\n<p>He became Darth Vader and started acting evilly, in the same way highly conscious individuals often do. This indicates that consciousness cannot be the only factor for and individual to receive voting power.

Going into one direction has a cost function related to the bee fatigue. If it doesn’t find pollen after a long run, best to abort mission and return to the hive to rest and recover energy. When that happens the hive is encouraged to welcome that bee with proud, happiness and warming comfort.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h1>Ethereum Classic community development</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://cdn.ethnews.com/images/1024x512/ETC-declaration-of-independence-1024x512-08-11-2016.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 4.

Some deliberately misinterpret it to mean that “ETC supports thieves and crooks” and similar nonsense. Let’s get some things straight. Code is law on the blockchain. In the sense, all executions and transactions are final and immutable. So, from our (Ethereum Classic supporters) standpoint by pushing the DAO hard fork EF broke the “law” in the sense that they imposed an invalid transaction state on the blockchain.</p>\\n<p>This has nothing to do with contractual or criminal law, or other legal considerations. Stating that “code is law” is similar to acknowledging the laws of physics. The law of gravity says that when I push a piano out of a window, the piano will fall downwards. It does not mean that it’s necessarily “legal” for me to push that piano out of that window. And if I do so and the falling piano kills some passer-by, it would be insane for me to argue before the judge that I shouldn’t go to jail because I broke no laws of physics.</p>\\n<p>On Ethereum blockchain, a Turing complete code operates with a very real and tangible value. Because of this, there is always a potential for mistakes and unintended outcomes. There will always be transactions and code execution results that someone is not happy about. There will be conflicts and disagreements, there will be code vulnerabilities and exploits, there will be scams and thefts, there will be all kinds of ugly things.</p>\\n<p>Who should deal with all these conflicts? Let’s imagine for a moment that we decided ‘the blockchain community’ will take it upon itself to deal with it all.</p>\\n<p>Who is going to make a call which on-chain code execution is “theft,” and which is not? Is this ponzi contract scammy enough to shut it down? Do we tolerate this dark market while it sells fake ids and marijuana, but draw the line once it starts to dabble in child porn and cocaine?</p>\\n<p>Should there be a democratic voting system (moot court) to decide on these cases, changing the blockchain state based on such decisions? Should there be a committee that decides what smart contract behavior is ‘unacceptable’ and what transactions are ‘illegal’ enough to justify a hard fork?</p>\\n<p>What may serve as a basis for such decisions? Where is the applicable body of law? Who is going to be the police, the judge and the jury? What is a due process? What is the appeal procedure? A lot of questions, and no good answers to these questions, when it comes to “blockchain justice”.</p>\\n<p>But it’s even worse if there is no system at all. If ‘the blockchain community’ just makes a special exception in regards to a ‘special case’, choosing to administer justice ‘just this one time’. What is so special about this case, one may ask? Why does this theft get a special treatment, and the other thefts don’t? Who do you need to know, whose buddy do you need to be to get such exceptional treatment? How are you going to defend such preferential treatment against legal cases citing a precedent and subpoenas demanding reversal of specific transactions?</p>\\n<p>It’s this whole snake’s nest that could be avoided by refusing to be dragged into conflict resolution and quest for justice as related to smart contract execution. And it only requires sticking to principles of blockchain neutrality and immutability.</p>\\n<p>So, code is law on the blockchain. All executions are final, all transactions are immutable. For everything else, there is a time-tested way to adjudicate legal disputes and carry out the administration of justice. It’s called legal system.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 413 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"The Invisible Field\",\"date\":\"2016-09-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"ProphetDaniel\",\"body\":\"<h1>Inspiration</h1>\\n<p>You might not see it.

Imagine you decide to make your house remotely controllable with text commands while you are on travel.  You decide to take extreme measures and only send commands over the Internet that have been SHA-256 hashed 100 times.  The following Python code will encrypt your commands thusly:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> hashlib\\n\\nNUM_OF_HASHES = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n\\nencrypted_text = input(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"What is the house command? \\\"</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> i <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> range(NUM_OF_HASHES):\\n        encrypted_text = hashlib.sha256(encrypted_text.encode()).hexdigest()\\n\\nprint(encrypted_text)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can run the script yourself to see that for the command “WATER THE LAWN NOW”, the encrypted text to send will be:</p>\\n<p><code>0e7a9b2e305988a09ca6431dcc2ccff50db2e0922e43d90c3950f1b16842a82f</code></p>\\n<p>For the command “INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE 5 DEGREES”, the encrypted text will be:</p>\\n<p><code>66e14d7c75f8ef72a74d99d6690169aff310b7c6cc0d79ad09a945e8c926cf17</code></p>\\n<p>If someone listens in on the transmission, all they would see is unintelligible bits.  Imagine the mischief someone could cause by resending the above two encrypted commands to your house every ten minutes nonstop.  This is another example of an attack that is easily carried out.  The attack is even effective against (apparently) strong encryption!</p>\\n<h1>Protecting Against Replay Attacks</h1>\\n<p>The problem with the aforementioned scenarios is that the same messages always have the <em>same</em> corresponding encoded text.  This method, with regards to encryption, is referred to as Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  What is needed is some <em>variability</em> in all messages.  For example, imagine if the date and time were added to messages with the understanding that messages were to be ignored after an agreed upon expiry.  That would prevent replay attacks.  Another simple solution is to add a unique number to every message.  Unique message numbers are referred to as <em>nonces</em>.</p>\\n<h1>What About Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic?</h1>\\n<p>Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) <em>do</em> have protection against replay attacks.  All transactions on both systems have nonces!  If you send me some ETH tokens from your ETH account,  I cannot replay that transaction (“double spend”) on the ETH system to get more; likewise for the ETC system.  However, both systems are sometimes vulnerable to replay attacks involving the resending of transactions <em>between</em> systems.  The reason for this is that the uniqueness of corresponding nonces between the two systems is not required.</p>\\n<h4><strong><em>The replay attack transaction</em></strong></h4>\\n<p><strong><em>0x87f8a62d4f04776701e95672b85838c818ceff3102d72be9377ede77ed59f83b</em></strong>\\n<strong><em>(minus the digital signature) on ETH block 1,920,100:</em></strong></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Nonce</td>\\n<td>115255</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Sending Address</td>\\n<td>0x4bb96091ee9d802ed039c4d1a5f6216f90f81b01</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Receiving Address</td>\\n<td>0x5d438e155d0b38c568496c411a4bcc1dcf45632a</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Sending</td>\\n<td>5.008931333047880161</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Data Sending</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Max Gas Units Can Use</td>\\n<td>90000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Price Per Gas Unit In Ether</td>\\n<td>0.000000021786783329</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h4><strong><em>The same replay attack transaction</em></strong></h4>\\n<p><strong><em>0x87f8a62d4f04776701e95672b85838c818ceff3102d72be9377ede77ed59f83b</em></strong>\\n<strong><em>(minus the digital signature) on ETC block 1,920,021:</em></strong></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Nonce</td>\\n<td>115255</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Sending Address</td>\\n<td>0x4bb96091ee9d802ed039c4d1a5f6216f90f81b01</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Receiving Address</td>\\n<td>0x5d438e155d0b38c568496c411a4bcc1dcf45632a</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Sending</td>\\n<td>5.008931333047880161</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Data Sending</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Max Gas Units Can Use</td>\\n<td>90000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Price Per Gas Unit In Ether</td>\\n<td>0.000000021786783329</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>What specific funds are at risk?  Funds associated with the <em>same</em> address on <em>both</em> blockchains are at risk.  Therefore, this pertains to all funds existing before the ETH hard fork that now exist on both systems.  Notice this vulnerability does not pertain to the DAO related funds with modified histories.  This is because these funds do not exist at the same addresses on both blockchains.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part One</h1>\\n<p>The easiest solution is to just send your funds to an exchange that promises to secure your funds for you.  If you want to protect your funds yourself, you need to add variability between the funds on both blockchains.  Since nonces are not providing that, another method is needed.  The easiest way to add variability is to move funds to <em>different</em> addresses on each blockchain.  Using two wallets, one for each system, send the funds from the same addresses to different addresses on each system.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Two</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may wonder whether the transactions that send funds to different addresses on each blockchain are themselves vulnerable to replay attacks.  There <em>is</em> a possibility that your attempt to add variability in the addresses fails.  But, that would just mean that your funds end up on the same new addresses on both systems controlled by you!  You could simply keep trying until you succeed in sending your funds to different addresses on each blockchain.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Three</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may also wonder whether an aggressive attacker could make it impossible to successfully move funds as required to protect them.  Assume all transactions are instantly copied to both systems.  The countermeasure for this situation relies on the fact that there is uncertainty in the time required to process (“mine”) new transactions on blockchains that use proof of work information.   You could broadcast the two transactions, meant for different blockchains, to <em>one</em> blockchain.  Why would this thwart every replay attack?  Remember that the ETH and ETC systems both have replay attack protection with regards to multiple transactions on the <em>same</em> blockchain.  One of the transactions should be accepted, and one rejected, on each blockchain.  No one can predict which of the two transactions will be accepted on either blockchain without also compromising mining nodes.  It may take multiple attempts, but, eventually funds will end up at different addresses on each system.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Four</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may also wonder whether new funds, sent to old addresses that previously held funds on both systems, are also vulnerable to replay attacks.  In some cases the answer is yes.  The simplest advice regarding that concern is to just avoid doing that.  In other words, do <em>not</em> reuse vulnerable addresses.  Arrange it so that no funds are ever sent to those addresses again.  If someone nevertheless insists on reusing addresses that exist on both chains, more work is required to secure future funds sent to those addresses.</p>\\n<h1>Parting Thoughts</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/83099acf43.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"coyote\\\"></p>\\n<p>Everyone must be vigilant about protecting their cryptocurrency.  Fortunately, there are effective tools and techniques that provide adequate safeguards.  The dangers cannot be ignored.  As an old Navajo proverb says:</p>\\n<p>“Coyote is always out there waiting, and Coyote is always hungry.”</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Hash trees, or Merkle trees, can also help <em>identify</em> invalid bits with minimal communication.</p>\\n<h1>El Paquete Semanal</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa6d5fc9.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"sign\\\"></p>\\n<p>To understand the importance of Merkle trees for blockchains, consider El Paquete Semanal (“the Weekly Package”), part of one of the strangest peer to peer networks in the world.  Every week a terabyte of YouTube videos, pop music MP3s, Spanish news articles and more is distributed to Cubans for a few pesos.  Distribution sometimes depends on such methods as passing hard drives around by hand.  This is because connectivity in Cuba is so poor.  95% of homes have none, and, the remaining 5% are subject to strong censorship. Suppose you wanted to give everyone a <em>perfect</em> copy of  El Paquete Semanal.  Because of the slowness of the network, it is impractical to resend copies to correct errors.  How would you quickly find and fix errors without resending many bits?  That is where Merkle trees come in.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa5e09b5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"house\\\"></p>\\n<h1>Fast Search</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa2df772.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"map\\\"></p>\\n<p>To understand why Merkle trees can be used to find errors so efficiently, try this activity: Have a friend pick any city in any part of the world. Google Maps might be helpful. Start asking yes / no questions to determine the city. You might ask questions like, “Is the city above or below the equator?”, and, “Is it to the east or west of Cairo?”. You should notice that cutting the search space approximately in half every question leads to the answer amazingly fast. Merkle trees allow a similarly fast search.</p>\\n<h1>Merkle Trees</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa48ed9d.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"merkle\\\"></p>\\n<p>Here is a Merkle tree recipe to quickly find corrupted segments in El Paquete Semanal:</p>\\n<p>Split it into eight segments and hash those segments. In the figure above, those eight hashes are represented by the boxes labelled 8 through 15. Then, hash consecutive <em>pairs</em> of those hashes. These are represented by the boxes labelled 4 through 7. Hash consecutive pairs of this second set of hashes as well.  These are represented by the boxes labelled 2 and 3.  Finally, hash these last two hashes. This is represented by the box labelled 1. Refer to the hash corresponding to label 1 as hash 1, the hash corresponding to label 2 as hash 2, etc.</p>\\n<p>Check hash 1 to determine if there are any errors to fix or not. Suppose the segment associated with hash 13 is corrupt. Check hashes 2 and 3 to determine the erroneous segment is associated with hash 6 or 7. Then, check hashes 6 and 7 to determine the bad segment is associated with hash 12 or 13. Finally, check hashes 12 and 13 to determine the faulty segment is associated with hash 13. Smaller segments would require a similar process with more levels to the Merkle tree.</p>\\n<p>For many small segments (lots of levels), using a Merkle tree to check and fix a remote copy requires much less communication than sending all the hashes of all the segments. It minimizes communications at the expense of some extra hash calculations.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa22d881.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"last\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchain systems rely on many clever data structures and algorithms.  Merkle trees are muy importante for making blockchain systems operate quickly and efficiently.</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Over 90% of banking transactions are done online, and, it was the first country to have worldwide electronic voting. In 2007 Estonia also experienced the first cyberwar. Over the course of three weeks, over a <em>million</em> computers from fifty countries attacked its information infrastructure.  Hundreds of government, banking, university and news sites were crippled or shut down by DOS attacks.  There had been cyber attacks before, but, never had an entire country been targeted and its national security so threatened.</p>\\n<h1>Denial Of Service Attacks</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82ed12c445.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"anon\\\"></p>\\n<p>DOS attacks attempt to make computer resources unavailable. If attacks originate from several computers, they are often referred to as distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. These are commonly executed by sending large amounts of traffic to computing targets. DOS attacks may be <em>unintentional</em>. When Michael Jackson died, news sites slowed or crashed in response to the increased traffic.  DOS attacks may even arguably sometimes be <em>legitimate</em>.  In 2011 the group of hackers known as Anonymous executed DOS attacks against PayPal, MasterCard and Visa to protest their refusal to process WikiLeaks donations.  They claimed this was rightful protest and no different in principle than Occupy Wall Street.  DOS attacks may even be <em>governmental</em>.  Edward Snowden revealed that the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in the United Kingdom has developed DOS attack tools. Lastly, DOS attack vulnerabilities, without great effort, may be <em>undetectable</em>.  An address blacklist was proposed to deal with the Ethereum DAO attack.  Shortly thereafter, an overlooked DOS attack vulnerability was discovered with this scheme and the proposal was dropped.</p>\\n<h1>Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic Denial Of Service Attacks</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82ed206b72.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ethlogo\\\"></p>\\n<p>The recent DOS attacks against the Ethereum system started in September around the time of the developer conference in Shanghai. Vulnerabilities were exploited.  Vulnerabilities were later patched.  Then, new vulnerabilities would repeat the cycle over and over again. The attacker, or attackers, spent thousands of dollars to keep this going for several weeks. Eventually the Ethereum Classic system was also attacked in a similar manner.</p>\\n<p>Anyone can send large numbers of transactions to several Ethereum and Ethereum Classic nodes. Therefore, <em>anyone</em> can degrade these systems for the other participants <em>anytime</em>.  This is typically not done because it would be horrendously expensive to keep it up for very long. The current attacks were possible because some Ethereum and Ethereum Classic instructions were <em>underpriced</em> relative to the amount of resources they tied up. Examples include EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, BALANCE, SLOAD, CALL, CALLDELEGATE, CALLCODE and SUICIDE. Some attack transactions cheaply invoked EXTCODESIZE tens of thousands of times!  Price adjustments to remove these vulnerabilities have necessitated changes to the systems (hard forks).</p>\\n<h1>Antifragility</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82ed2780ed.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"antifrag\\\"></p>\\n<p>In the long term, these attacks might actually be <em>beneficial</em>.  The Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks are antifragile. Antifragility is the property of improving in response to stressors. Immune systems, bones, muscles, economies, theories and the mythological Hydra are antifragile. Every time a new attack is exposed, the developers eventually remove the vulnerability. Therefore, every attack makes the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems stronger!</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Hard forks have caused more grief than probably anything else in the history of blockchains.  Additional hard forks are being discussed now by the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic communities to deal with issues caused by the recent denial of service attack spam. Fortunately, there is nothing problematic about the proposed hard forks.  I will describe an analogous technology and details of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems to show why all is well.</p>\\n<h1>Java Virtual Machine</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/ed6df2c02c.png\\\" alt=\\\"java\\\"></p>\\n<p>People own various computing devices.  People also run various versions and types of operating systems.  The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows disparate systems to all run programs and get the <em>exact</em> same results.  People have implemented the JVM in hardware, but, most just simulate it in software.  Some use compilers with no optimizations.  Some use “just in time” compilers.  Some use “ahead of time” compilers. Few care about the differences in JVM realizations as long as program results are <em>always</em> identical.  If a complex Java based weather simulation predicts the temperature in one week will be 78.91775159 °F, and all JVM instances also compute 78.91775159 °F, then everyone is happy.</p>\\n<h1>Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic Virtual Machines</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/0dbe7e221c.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ETH\\\"></p>\\n<p>The Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems are also “virtual” machines.  They are imaginary machines that are <em>simulated</em>.  There is no Ethereum or Ethereum Classic world computer  located in a bunker somewhere.  The JVM allows everyone to effectively run programs on identical <em>clones</em> of a computer.  Astonishingly, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic allow everyone to effectively run programs on the same <em>instance</em> of a computer.  In other words, it is as if everyone is using the same single machine! As with the JVM, few care how this is done as long as the results are the same.  The recent denial of service attacks took advantage of the way the systems are currently simulated. The proposed hard forks will just improve the <em>efficiency</em>. All results will remain the same.</p>\\n<h1>More Details On The Proposed Hard Forks</h1>\\n<h4><strong><em>Ethereum attack contract account 0x7c20218efc2e07c8fe2532ff860d4a5d8287cb31 as of 2016-10-26 15:00:00 UTC that created over 2.4 million empty accounts:</em></strong></h4>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Balance</td>\\n<td>0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Contract Code</td>\\n<td>0x7f6004600c60003960046000f3600035ff00000000000000000000000…</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Storage Dictionary</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Counter (Nonce)</td>\\n<td>34148</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The state of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems at all times depends on all the previous activity.  Computations affect <em>accounts</em>.  There are <em>external</em> accounts and <em>contract</em> accounts. All accounts have four components: an ether balance, contract code, storage dictonary (associative array), and, a counter (nonce).  For external accounts, the counter tracks the submitted transactions.  For contract accounts, the counter tracks the created contracts. There is no reason for network nodes to store anything for accounts that either do not exist or are empty.  The attacks created millions of empty accounts that are using massive amounts of storage.  The proposed hard forks will just stop wasting space for these accounts.¹ As this storage is not in the blockchain, <strong>no changes to the blockchain are involved</strong>.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><sub>1. Technically the proposed hard forks will also likely lead to slight gas costs to recreate these accounts.</sub></p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

The effect of this attack was effectively making both networks hardly usable: blockchain sync becoming extremely slow and halting unpredictably, valid transactions taking extremely long time to make it into a block, and full nodes (both parity and geth) crashing due to difficulties processing spam transactions bloat.</p>\\n<p>It turns out that the client code fixes can do only so much to protect the network from this type of attacks. In order to close the attack vector completely, a non-backwards-compatible change is needed that reprices some operations to better reflect their impact on the nodes and the network. Which can be done only through a hard fork.</p>\\n<p>From the very beginning of Ethereum Classic project, we made it clear that hard forks are only acceptable in order to correct protocol-level bugs, fix security vulnerabilities, and provide functionality upgrades, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. The gas reprice hard fork provides an important security fix and does not violate any principles that the Ethereum Classic community rallied around.</p>\\n<p>The technical details of the hard fork are expressed in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/issues/17\\\">ECIP-1050</a> (<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/150\\\">EIP-150 for Ethereum</a>), and the fork code is currently being implemented and tested by ETC dev team.</p>\\n<p>It is important to note that ETH team chose another timeframe for hard fork implementation, to be effective on ETH block 2463000. Unfortunately, geth 1.4.18 released by Ethereum Foundation developers <strong>does not</strong> properly take --oppose-dao flag into consideration when implementing hard fork changes on block 2463000. Therefore, it becomes impossible to use this geth release as Ethereum Classic client.</p>\\n<p><strong>All ETC full node users and miners are advised to upgrade to either <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases\\\">Classic version of geth</a> or <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethcore/parity/releases/\\\">Parity</a> full node (which implements ETC hard fork properly) as soon as possible.</strong></p>\\n<p>Users of the light ETC wallets (such as <a href=\\\"https://jaxx.io/\\\">Jaxx</a>), <a href=\\\"http://classicetherwallet.com/\\\">web wallet</a> or <a href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classicetherwallet-cx/opggclcfcbfbchcienjdaohghcamjfhf\\\">Chrome extension</a> should not be affected. Your ETC located in the exchange accounts also should be safe through a hard fork transition. Mist or EthereumWallet users should use Parity or Classic geth as a backend, as explained <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peAnJ3rRn04\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h3>UPDATE: ETC community successfully implemented GasReprice hard fork</h3>\\n<p>Block 2,500,000 passed without any issues, and ETC GasReprice hard fork is now effective. There was no netsplit, and ETC nethash did not change in any significant way, as can be seen on ETCstats network monitor.</p>\\n<p>We appreciate continued support of ETC exchanges, wallets and mining pools who upgraded their infrastructure in a timely manner and contributed to a smooth transition through the hard fork event.</p>\\n<p>First Ethereum Classic hard fork is a significant milestone for ETC community. Congratulations to classic geth and parity developers on the successful implementation and testing of the hard fork code! Many community members distributed information about the fork, helped ETC users to upgrade or troubleshooted various infrastructure issues.

Though many users in ETC look forward to a future of decentralized applications and smart contracts running on the blockchain but are dissatisfied with the current supply schedule of 5 ETC awarded per block which is created on average every 14 seconds.</p>\\n<p>As of the time of this writing, the available supply of ETC stands at 85.4 Million coins in circulation and users can’t help but compare that to Bitcoin’s 15.96 Million. For every 1 BTC there are 5 ETC and Bitcoin is 7 years older! Ethereum started with a Pre-Mine of 72 Million and by 2055, if nothing is changed, there will be about 500 Million ETC.</p>\\n<h2>A Network Upgrade</h2>\\n<p>The current supply schedule for ETC is a bug, not a feature. A tightening of supply similar to Bitcoin’s would constitute as a network upgrade. The upward pressure on price due to the increased scarcity would encourage more mining, savings, and investment into ETC dApps and smart contracts.</p>\\n<p>The want and need for change in the money supply even had 77% support in one poll conducted by the Ethereum Classic Twitter Account.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/CUvJyj0.png\\\" alt=\\\"Monetary Policy Poll\\\"></p>\\n<p>Granted, it was not a scientific poll, but it seems to be an indicator of where the general ETC community stands on wanting to change policy.</p>\\n<h2>The Tithing Event</h2>\\n<p>Below are two <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5a8f5l/monetary_policy_analysis_help_doc_spreadsheet/\\\">proposals by user “Snaproll”</a> for changing the block reward of ETC. They are similar in nature to the supply schedule of Bitcoin which has proven to be a successful model were created with the goal of a CAP close to 210 million ETC. So that for every 1 BTC, there are roughly 10 ETC.</p>\\n<h3>Option A: “Tithing” at 10% Block Reward</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>10% Decrease in block reward every 3 million blocks.</li>\\n<li>3 million blocks is roughly 1.4 Years</li>\\n<li>Theoretical Max CAP at 222 million, CAP in reality closer to 210 million.</li>\\n<li>99% of ETC mined by 2071, CAP hit after 2164</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Option B: “Tithing” at 20% Block Reward.</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>20% Decrease in block reward every 6 million blocks.</li>\\n<li>6 million blocks is roughly 2.8 Years</li>\\n<li>Theoretical Max CAP at 222 million, CAP in reality closer to 210 million.</li>\\n<li>99% of ETC mined by 2066, CAP hit after 2157</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Out of the two proposals, I prefer “Option A.” The tithing at 10%, for the reason that a change in supply schedule is done on the same day as the “Freeze of the Difficulty Bomb” network upgrade at block 3 million. It sends a clear signal to the market that ETC has taken steps towards it’s long term future and place in the crypto-currency market.</p>\\n<p>Follow Ethereum Classic Twitter and Reddit for more updates on monetary policy:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eth_classic\\\">https://twitter.com/eth_classic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic\\\">https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 420 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"ETC Newsletter : 2016-10-24 - 2016-11-01\",\"date\":\"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Carlo Vicari\",\"body\":\"<h2>Links</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ethereumclassic.github.io/\\\">ETC Website</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/\\\">ETC Reddit</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/eth_classic\\\">ETC Twitter</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/\\\">ETC Facebook</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ethereumclassic.herokuapp.com/\\\">ETC Slack</a></p>\\n<h2>ETC Development Report.</h2>\\n<p>With the recent protocol update complete, focus has now shifted towards monetary\\npolicy and governance models.

Information may be lost due to computer or human errors and corruption.  In 2014, half a <em>billion</em> Yahoo accounts were compromised.  Just a few months ago, the Air Force lost 12 <em>years</em> of investigative records.  Therefore, it continues to be problematic to trust companies and governments with information.</p>\\n<h1>Blockchains</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/8f27a142e5.png\\\" alt=\\\"blockchain\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchains are decentralized, secure, reliable and convenient databases.  Nobody trusts anybody and no one is in charge.  Nevertheless, blockchains are still used to store valuable assets including life savings and land titles.</p>\\n<p>Blockchain asset information is stored in records referred to as <em>transactions</em>.  Transactions are organized into <em>blocks</em> which are further organized into <em>chains</em>.  Cryptographic tools such as hashing functions and digital signatures help provide security.  For additional security, to add new blocks, people must compute results referred to as <em>proof of work information</em>.  To encourage this, calculation of proof of work information leads to cryptocurrency rewards.  People that compete to compute proof of work information, and receive cryptocurrency rewards, are referred to as <em>miners</em>.</p>\\n<h1>A Weird Analog</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/929126b195.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"smith\\\"></p>\\n<p>For an analog to blockchain systems, consider free market economies.  In free markets, goods and services are not in general managed by <em>anyone</em>.  Like blockchain systems, they are decentralized.  Interestingly, free market economies work better than controlled economies.  Adam Smith noticed, over 200 years ago, that individuals pursuing their own interests often benefit society more so than if they intentionally tried to benefit society.  It is as if every man is, in the words of Adam Smith, “led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.”  Likewise, unmanaged blockchain systems work better than managed database systems for some applications.</p>\\n<h1>Competition Is Foundational</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/8f298eaef5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"trading\\\"></p>\\n<p>Free market economies work so well largely because of competition.  Competition improves productivity, efficiency, quality and more.  Likewise, competition is foundational to blockchain systems.  Widespread competition in mining provides resilience and security.  Free market economies are threatened when competition is dimished, such as when monopolies form.  Blockchain systems are threatened when a miner controls a majority of the mining resources (51% attack).</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/95d3b10b77.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dali\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchain systems are able to effectively manage information in a trustless manner.  They are able to do this partly by utilizing the power of competition.  If blockchains seem unbelievable, consider that many are <em>still</em> skeptical of  free markets for similar reasons.

Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature.

Such cooperation will involve not only human beings, groups and\\nassociations but also a growing multitude of increasingly independent\\nartificial agents.</p>\\n<p>Every blockchain creates a social network around its applications, with network value growing exponentially with the number of participants in accordance with Reed’s Law. This value isn’t extracted by intermediaries or controllers, as with previous centralized models. Instead, it’s shared among participants, providing economic incentives for cooperation without coercion.</p>\\n<p>Not all blockchains are created equal. There are three key characteristics that make scalable blockchain-enabled cooperation possible: openness, neutrality and immutability.</p>\\n<p><strong>Openness is necessary</strong>. It goes without saying that the rules of the game should be open for anyone to see and understand. Anyone should be able to participate in any layer of the system without asking for any permission whatsoever. Anyone should be able to use the network in accordance with its rules. Anyone should be able to create their own client implementing the open protocol. Anyone should be able to contribute to network security, and so on. No registration, identification or other preconditions should limit participation. All such limitations prevent the network from scaling and their enforcement creates centralization risks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Neutrality is necessary</strong>. It’s important for anyone participating in\\nblockchain-enabled cooperation to be on an equal footing with everyone else. It doesn’t matter if you wield huge economic power or only a tiny amount. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a saintly Mother Theresa or a vicious drug dealer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a human or a refrigerator. It doesn’t matter what you believe in, what political theory you subscribe to, or whether you’re a moral or immoral person. A participant’s ethnicity, age, sex, profession, social standing, friends or affiliations, make or model, goals, purposes or intentions — none of this matters to the blockchain even a bit. The rules of the game are exactly the same for everyone, period. Without neutrality, the system is skewed towards one set of participants at the expense of others. In that case, it’s less likely to gain universal acceptance and maximize network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p><strong>Immutability is necessary</strong>. The blockchain is a truth machine preserving one universally accepted version of history, one immutable sequence of events. What’s true once is always true, regardless of political or business interests, and no amount of lobbying can change that. If it’s simply not possible to change history, then no resources are wasted on the effort. If there are any loopholes at all, then sufficiently motivated and determined interest groups will exploit them at the expense of others, diminishing network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p>The rules governing the blockchain network are known in advance. They’re exactly the same for everyone and not subject to change other than with 100% consensus. Yes, it must be 100%. Because any change to the system’s rules that not all participants freely agree to creates a network split, diminishing network value for everyone.</p>\\n<p>It’s impossible to achieve these blockchain characteristics without the system\\nbeing <strong>truly decentralized</strong>. If any aspect of the blockchain system becomes\\nsubject to centralized control, this introduces an attack vector enabling the\\nviolation of one or more of the key blockchain characteristics. It may be\\npossible to limit participation (such as by enforcing AML/KYC rules), thus\\nviolating openness. It may be possible to enforce discriminatory policies (such as by filtering “illegal” transactions), thus violating neutrality. It may be possible to rewrite the history of events (such as by confiscating or\\n“redistributing” funds), thus violating immutability. Introducing centralized\\nchokepoints creates a precondition for the introduction of “blockchain\\nintermediaries or controllers” who can siphon value out of the system at other participants’ expense.</p>\\n<p>So decentralization is the most important feature of blockchain systems, the one everything else depends on. With decentralization, blockchains will come to rule the world. Without it, they’ll be “contained” and railroaded into niche applications.</p>\\n<p><strong>We decentralists</strong> are committed to keeping blockchains open, neutral and\\nimmutable. We’re committed to keeping blockchain systems decentralized. This informs all our actions and positions towards any developments in the crypto world and beyond. All attempts to violate any of the key blockchain\\ncharacteristics should be fought. All changes to a blockchain’s rules that\\nintroduce new centralization risks or strengthen existing ones should be fought. Only developments that are clearly beneficial to decentralization or strengthen the three key blockchain characteristics should be supported and encouraged.\\nThe blockchain revolution won’t be centralized. Let’s make sure of it.</p>\\n<p><strong>Onward.</strong></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016-07-11-manifesto.md\n ** module id = 400\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Let's keep the original censorship-resistant Ethereum going!\",\"date\":\"2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Arvicco\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nIUazw_u3KChCX89fLgLDg.png\\\" alt=\\\"Ethereum Classic Logo\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Ideology</h2>\\n<p>We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can’t shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone.</p>\\n<p>More: <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede\\\">https://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede</a></p>\\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\\n<p>Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (diligently hidden, pro-fork) coin vote on <a href=\\\"http://carbonvote.com/\\\">Carbonvote</a>, 19% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners voted against the previous ‘DAO softfork’ and would logically oppose hardfork as well. Such a significant minority of stakeholders should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a clear choice.</p>\\n<p>If we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized applications that are actually censorship resistant.</p>\\n<p>More: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic/freeworldcomputer-project\\\">https://github.com/ethereumclassic/freeworldcomputer-project</a></p>\\n<h2>Goals</h2>\\n<p>The main goal of the project is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.</p>\\n<h2>Plan</h2>\\n<h3>Development</h3>\\n<p>We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereum\\\">https://github.com/ethereum</a> development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.</p>\\n<p>Code: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic\\\">https://github.com/ethereumclassic</a></p>\\n<h3>Community</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.ethereumclassic.org\\\">https://www.ethereumclassic.org</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/\\\">https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\\n<p>Please help us spread the word about this project in Ethereum community!</p>\\n<h3>Volunteers</h3>\\n<p>If you feel strongly about the cause, please get involved. With just days before the planned hardfork, we need your support to ensure original Ethereum survival. We need more developers, website designers, people who can write and advocate the need for Ethereum Classic. Please let us know what are your skills and how you would like to contribute. Redditors, please <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4sxupj/making_sure_original_ethereum_survives_please_get/\\\">reply here</a>. Github users, please <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/new\\\">open new issue</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Users</h3>\\n<p>In order to remain on the original Ethereum chain, just don’t upgrade to hardfork client version pushed by Ethereum Foundation. We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.</p>\\n<p>Fun fact. If you keep ETH under your direct control (not in a 3rd party wallet or exchange account), you will have <strong>two</strong> sets of coins instead of one post-fork. You could then install a forked Ethereum client in addition to Ethereum Classic, copy your private keys there and use your coins on both chains! You won’t be so lucky if your ETH are locked with 3rd party going into the fork - some exchanges <a href=\\\"https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sy7w6/breaking_kraken_on_the_july_20th_ethereum/\\\">already announced</a> that they will only return one type of coin post-fork to its users.</p>\\n<h3>Miners</h3>\\n<p>Miners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic\\\">https://github.com/ethereumclassic</a>.</p>\\n<p>The difficulty of the original chain will be quite high post-fork, but it will adjust to actual hashrate shortly (just 2048 blocks, a few hours). Since it is expected that most hashrate will move to hardfoked chain, post-adjustment it will be possible to obtain decent mining rewards in classic ethers even with solo mining.</p>\\n<p>Mining pool supporting the original chain is currently under development, please check here in a couple of days.</p>\\n<h3>Traders</h3>\\n<p>Most important question for traders is ‘will ETC have market price’? There are all reasons to believe that it will. Essentially, ETC is an Ethereum <a href=\\\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0\\\">‘spinoff coin’</a> with a wide user base of all current ETH users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won’t. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. Additional reasoning why <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5dawgg\\\">ETC is very unlikely to be ‘worthless’</a>.</p>\\n<p>One exchange agreed to carry ETC already. It’s Bitsquare which is planning to <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5e1oo7\\\">add ETC trading right after the fork</a>. Other trading venues will follow. We are in talks with several exchanges to add ETC to their platforms (or re-introduce trading for the exchanges that previously traded ethers).</p>\\n<h4>Let’s make sure original Ethereum vision doesn’t just “go gentle into that good night”!</h4>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016-07-15-start-project.md\n ** module id = 401\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"ETC - new Ethereum Classic ticker symbol\",\"date\":\"2016-07-22T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Arvicco\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Logo_ETC_TV_2015.png\\\" alt=\\\"ETC\\\"></p>\\n<p>Now that we moved through the most difficult part of the post-fork transition and ensured our chain survival, we may focus on other things. Like branding, for example. Some people have noticed that I’ve started to use ETC ticker for Ethereum Classic instead of ETH-C. Why? Here is the rationale.</p>\\n<p>ETH-C ticker served us well in the process of HF transition. When we tried to explain the difference between pre-forked and post-forked tokens to the community, we could say that legacy ETH ‘splits’ into two separate tokens, namely ETH-F and ETH-C. It was logically consistent and helped us to convey our idea.</p>\\n<p>After the transition happened, there is a problem with this narrative however: ‘ETH-F’ does not really exist. All the exchanges assigned ‘ETH’ ticker to the forked Ethereum, even if many people consider it incorrect, with the original Ethereum chain still <a href=\\\"https://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4ts1w4/hard_fork_went_smoothly_ethereum_classic_chain_is/\\\">very much alive</a>. So, ‘ETH-F’ just isn’t real. And so is ‘ETH-C’.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>In crypto-trading world, a four-letter ticker conveys inferiority, like a second-class citizen. We don’t want our ticker to be seen similar to some shitty 2nd rate altcoins.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>We don’t want to be second rate. Ethereum Classic has all the necessary components and a clear potential to grow into a major smart contract execution platform that is used by many types of dapps that critically depend on censorship-resistance. Dapps that are neither comfortable nor welcome on the forked blockchain, “mutable by democratic consensus”. And we want our ticker to reflect this ambition early on.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Three-letter codes are entrenched standard in forex/currency world. Most of the forex infrastructure is tied to these restrictions.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Ah, yes, standards. ISO 4217 Currency Codes only allows for 3-letter codes. Only major crypto-currencies that follow this convention will be acceptable to wider financial system down the road. All the rest would have to change their ticker mid-way.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Even in crypto-trading, some of the tools, trackers and exchanges don’t even support non-standard 4 letter codes. You can see BTC, LTC, ETH, but not DOGE, BTCD or USDT there.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>ETC (<strong>ET</strong>hereum <strong>C</strong>lassic) contrasts well to ETH ticker which is claimed by the forked chain, without looking second-rate to it. At the same time, this ticker has ‘a look and feel’ of important coins such as BTC, LTC… ETC?</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The ticker ETC is miraculously not yet claimed by other cryptos.

As each individual is motivated to propose organizational improvements, for each opportunity the organization has, several proposals might be sent for evaluation of the decision taking board. It’s probable that not all the proposals made are going to be funded because resources (matter, time, space, intelligent agents) are limited. So methods for selecting most fit proposals are often utilized. Here I present a method analogous to the genetic algorithm for selecting most fit proposals to be funded within an anarchist organization.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://miletrackgps.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dna.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 2 - Source <a href=\\\"https://miletrackgps.com/\\\">Mile Track GPS</a></p>\\n<h1>Proposed Algorithm</h1>\\n<p>A population of proposals to a problem is evolved toward better proposals. The evolution starts from a population of community generated proposals, and is an iterative process, with the population in each iteration called a generation of proposals. In each generation, the fitness of every proposal in the population is evaluated; The more fit proposals are selected from the current population, and each proposal details are modified to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate proposals is then used in the next iteration of the proposals algorithm. Commonly, the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.</p>\\n<h1>Measuring Fitness Of Each Proposal</h1>\\n<p>One way to effectively measure the fitness of proposals is by a simple democracy voting process. The problem with this method is that receiving bad votes can lead to the tiranny of the majority.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://t1.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/48/00/52/400_F_48005278_ll3uog4WdeW3maZ11URbnw3wXBsr9xUl.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 3 - Source <a href=\\\"http://t1.ftcdn.net/\\\">FTCDN</a></p>\\n<p>If somehow a method for measuring the quality of the votes was available, the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority\\\">tiranny of the majority</a> could be avoided.</p>\\n<h1>Measuring Quality of Votes</h1>\\n<p>The quality of the votes can be estimated with the conscience level each voter has.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://www.mytechanalyst.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CustomerSatChecklist-Depositphotos_4351613_xs.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 4 - Source <a href=\\\"http://www.mytechanalyst.net/\\\">My Tech Analyst</a></p>\\n<p>To better illustrate the conscience level parameter I’ll give a classical example called <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\\\">tragedy of the commons</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Tragedy of the Commons</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/I6EL2xy.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\">\\nFigure 5 - Source <a href=\\\"http://www.jborden.com/\\\">Jborden</a></p>\\n<p>People with less conscience would vote based on their own interest resulting in the depleting of the common resource whereas people with more conscience would actually vote for the collective handling of the common resource for added overall productivity.</p>\\n<p>If each individual has one vote, and 80% of the individuals are not conscious, full democracy would probably lead to depleting that resource. Let’s then imagine a system that will give 5 votes for each individual that passes the courses called Tragedy Of The Commons and Correct Handling Of The Common Resource.</p>\\n<h2>Star Wars Analogy</h2>\\n<p>In Star Wars the consciousness level would be something like the <a href=\\\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian\\\">Midichlorian count</a>. The highest Midichlorian count is attributed in the series to <a href=\\\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker\\\">Anakin Skywalker</a>, above 20,000.</p>\\n<p>He became Darth Vader and started acting evilly, in the same way highly conscious individuals often do. This indicates that consciousness cannot be the only factor for and individual to receive voting power. Instead evilness has also to be considered.Recently BBC published a psychological test called “<a href=\\\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151123-how-dark-is-your-personality\\\">How dark is your personality</a>” to measure evilness.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://secure.static.tumblr.com/73d934c53ee607bed6434d88063fdccf/iotazsv/MlJnhmz4c/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_9et8m7056cws88wc04wsgcssk_640.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 6 - Source <a href=\\\"https://www.tumblr.com/\\\">Tumblr</a></p>\\n<p>Evilness can be modeled as a factor ranging from -1 to 1.\\nTo be fair with the community evolution:</p>\\n<p>Voting power of an individual = - Evilness * Consciousness Level.</p>\\n<p>Instead of a general consciousness level, people are often very conscious in one subject and unconscious in another. That means the consciousness level in the equation above, that gives an individual voting power, has to be about the subject being voted, i.e. the proposals population and the problem to be addressed.</p>\\n<p>Let’s then imagine a system that will give 5 votes for each individual that passes the courses called Tragedy Of The Commons and Correct Handling Of The Common Resource.</p>\\n<p>These courses are in fact relevant competences to the subject being voted, so an increase of these competences is positively related with a better vote.</p>\\n<h3>Measuring evilness of an individual</h3>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/36tTiow.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 6 - Source the author</p>\\n<p>The advent of the blockchain allowed the recording of information in a safe, decentralized and possibly immutable way. Taking into advantage this technology, the evil deeds of an individual can be recorded in a blockchain powered immutable ledger.</p>\\n<p>If that was done in the <a href=\\\"https://www.ethereum.org/\\\">forked Ethereum</a>, Darth Vader would have the possibility to attack his evilness ledger to make it not evil with the purpose of receiving voting power.</p>\\n<h1>Drawbacks</h1>\\n<p>This system might look overly complicated for a project selection process. Although with the advent of the <a href=\\\"http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_idea.html\\\">smart contracts</a> and computerized selection processes, the burden part of the process can be computer aided. After a few rounds people should get used to it.</p>\\n<h1>Insights</h1>\\n<p>This topic was motivated from my participation in the <a href=\\\"https://ethereumclassic.org/\\\">Ethereum Classic</a> community and first posted at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/39\\\">Github - issue 39</a>.

If an individual can grab some fruits in one direction awesome. If it starts to starve in another, that direction might be cancelled like in a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight_foraging_hypothesis\\\">Lévy flight foraging hypothesis</a> performed by a bee looking for pollen for example.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/771e949dc083a2cb3fb4448639722773/tumblr_nk7hftM19a1qzfsnio5_r1_1280.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>Figure 2.

An example of 1000 steps of a Lévy flight in two dimensions. The origin of the motion is at [0,0], the angular direction is uniformly distributed and the step size is distributed according to a Lévy (i.e. stable) distribution with α = 1 and β = 0 which is a Cauchy distribution. Source <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight\\\">wikipedia</a>.</p>\\n<p>The analogy helps to understand a proposed dynamics for the community:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Each hive has limited resources depending upon the ecossytem where that hive is located among other factors.</li>\\n<li>The species (analogous to the community) can be considered as a population of hives.</li>\\n<li>Each bee’s purpose is to make its hive and species grow stronger. A bee is a high valued asset for the hive.

Some deliberately misinterpret it to mean that “ETC supports thieves and crooks” and similar nonsense. Let’s get some things straight. Code is law on the blockchain. In the sense, all executions and transactions are final and immutable. So, from our (Ethereum Classic supporters) standpoint by pushing the DAO hard fork EF broke the “law” in the sense that they imposed an invalid transaction state on the blockchain.</p>\\n<p>This has nothing to do with contractual or criminal law, or other legal considerations. Stating that “code is law” is similar to acknowledging the laws of physics. The law of gravity says that when I push a piano out of a window, the piano will fall downwards. It does not mean that it’s necessarily “legal” for me to push that piano out of that window. And if I do so and the falling piano kills some passer-by, it would be insane for me to argue before the judge that I shouldn’t go to jail because I broke no laws of physics.</p>\\n<p>On Ethereum blockchain, a Turing complete code operates with a very real and tangible value. Because of this, there is always a potential for mistakes and unintended outcomes. There will always be transactions and code execution results that someone is not happy about. There will be conflicts and disagreements, there will be code vulnerabilities and exploits, there will be scams and thefts, there will be all kinds of ugly things.</p>\\n<p>Who should deal with all these conflicts? Let’s imagine for a moment that we decided ‘the blockchain community’ will take it upon itself to deal with it all.</p>\\n<p>Who is going to make a call which on-chain code execution is “theft,” and which is not? Is this ponzi contract scammy enough to shut it down? Do we tolerate this dark market while it sells fake ids and marijuana, but draw the line once it starts to dabble in child porn and cocaine?</p>\\n<p>Should there be a democratic voting system (moot court) to decide on these cases, changing the blockchain state based on such decisions? Should there be a committee that decides what smart contract behavior is ‘unacceptable’ and what transactions are ‘illegal’ enough to justify a hard fork?</p>\\n<p>What may serve as a basis for such decisions? Where is the applicable body of law? Who is going to be the police, the judge and the jury? What is a due process? What is the appeal procedure? A lot of questions, and no good answers to these questions, when it comes to “blockchain justice”.</p>\\n<p>But it’s even worse if there is no system at all. If ‘the blockchain community’ just makes a special exception in regards to a ‘special case’, choosing to administer justice ‘just this one time’. What is so special about this case, one may ask? Why does this theft get a special treatment, and the other thefts don’t? Who do you need to know, whose buddy do you need to be to get such exceptional treatment? How are you going to defend such preferential treatment against legal cases citing a precedent and subpoenas demanding reversal of specific transactions?</p>\\n<p>It’s this whole snake’s nest that could be avoided by refusing to be dragged into conflict resolution and quest for justice as related to smart contract execution. And it only requires sticking to principles of blockchain neutrality and immutability.</p>\\n<p>So, code is law on the blockchain. All executions are final, all transactions are immutable. For everything else, there is a time-tested way to adjudicate legal disputes and carry out the administration of justice. It’s called legal system.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016-09-09-code-is-law.md\n ** module id = 412\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"The Invisible Field\",\"date\":\"2016-09-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"ProphetDaniel\",\"body\":\"<h1>Inspiration</h1>\\n<p>You might not see it.

Imagine you decide to make your house remotely controllable with text commands while you are on travel.  You decide to take extreme measures and only send commands over the Internet that have been SHA-256 hashed 100 times.  The following Python code will encrypt your commands thusly:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> hashlib\\n\\nNUM_OF_HASHES = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">100</span>\\n\\nencrypted_text = input(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"What is the house command? \\\"</span>)\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">for</span> i <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">in</span> range(NUM_OF_HASHES):\\n        encrypted_text = hashlib.sha256(encrypted_text.encode()).hexdigest()\\n\\nprint(encrypted_text)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can run the script yourself to see that for the command “WATER THE LAWN NOW”, the encrypted text to send will be:</p>\\n<p><code>0e7a9b2e305988a09ca6431dcc2ccff50db2e0922e43d90c3950f1b16842a82f</code></p>\\n<p>For the command “INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE 5 DEGREES”, the encrypted text will be:</p>\\n<p><code>66e14d7c75f8ef72a74d99d6690169aff310b7c6cc0d79ad09a945e8c926cf17</code></p>\\n<p>If someone listens in on the transmission, all they would see is unintelligible bits.  Imagine the mischief someone could cause by resending the above two encrypted commands to your house every ten minutes nonstop.  This is another example of an attack that is easily carried out.  The attack is even effective against (apparently) strong encryption!</p>\\n<h1>Protecting Against Replay Attacks</h1>\\n<p>The problem with the aforementioned scenarios is that the same messages always have the <em>same</em> corresponding encoded text.  This method, with regards to encryption, is referred to as Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  What is needed is some <em>variability</em> in all messages.  For example, imagine if the date and time were added to messages with the understanding that messages were to be ignored after an agreed upon expiry.  That would prevent replay attacks.  Another simple solution is to add a unique number to every message.  Unique message numbers are referred to as <em>nonces</em>.</p>\\n<h1>What About Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic?</h1>\\n<p>Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) <em>do</em> have protection against replay attacks.  All transactions on both systems have nonces!  If you send me some ETH tokens from your ETH account,  I cannot replay that transaction (“double spend”) on the ETH system to get more; likewise for the ETC system.  However, both systems are sometimes vulnerable to replay attacks involving the resending of transactions <em>between</em> systems.  The reason for this is that the uniqueness of corresponding nonces between the two systems is not required.</p>\\n<h4><strong><em>The replay attack transaction</em></strong></h4>\\n<p><strong><em>0x87f8a62d4f04776701e95672b85838c818ceff3102d72be9377ede77ed59f83b</em></strong>\\n<strong><em>(minus the digital signature) on ETH block 1,920,100:</em></strong></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Nonce</td>\\n<td>115255</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Sending Address</td>\\n<td>0x4bb96091ee9d802ed039c4d1a5f6216f90f81b01</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Receiving Address</td>\\n<td>0x5d438e155d0b38c568496c411a4bcc1dcf45632a</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Sending</td>\\n<td>5.008931333047880161</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Data Sending</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Max Gas Units Can Use</td>\\n<td>90000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Price Per Gas Unit In Ether</td>\\n<td>0.000000021786783329</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h4><strong><em>The same replay attack transaction</em></strong></h4>\\n<p><strong><em>0x87f8a62d4f04776701e95672b85838c818ceff3102d72be9377ede77ed59f83b</em></strong>\\n<strong><em>(minus the digital signature) on ETC block 1,920,021:</em></strong></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Nonce</td>\\n<td>115255</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Sending Address</td>\\n<td>0x4bb96091ee9d802ed039c4d1a5f6216f90f81b01</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Receiving Address</td>\\n<td>0x5d438e155d0b38c568496c411a4bcc1dcf45632a</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Sending</td>\\n<td>5.008931333047880161</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Data Sending</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Max Gas Units Can Use</td>\\n<td>90000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Price Per Gas Unit In Ether</td>\\n<td>0.000000021786783329</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>What specific funds are at risk?  Funds associated with the <em>same</em> address on <em>both</em> blockchains are at risk.  Therefore, this pertains to all funds existing before the ETH hard fork that now exist on both systems.  Notice this vulnerability does not pertain to the DAO related funds with modified histories.  This is because these funds do not exist at the same addresses on both blockchains.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part One</h1>\\n<p>The easiest solution is to just send your funds to an exchange that promises to secure your funds for you.  If you want to protect your funds yourself, you need to add variability between the funds on both blockchains.  Since nonces are not providing that, another method is needed.  The easiest way to add variability is to move funds to <em>different</em> addresses on each blockchain.  Using two wallets, one for each system, send the funds from the same addresses to different addresses on each system.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Two</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may wonder whether the transactions that send funds to different addresses on each blockchain are themselves vulnerable to replay attacks.  There <em>is</em> a possibility that your attempt to add variability in the addresses fails.  But, that would just mean that your funds end up on the same new addresses on both systems controlled by you!  You could simply keep trying until you succeed in sending your funds to different addresses on each blockchain.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Three</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may also wonder whether an aggressive attacker could make it impossible to successfully move funds as required to protect them.  Assume all transactions are instantly copied to both systems.  The countermeasure for this situation relies on the fact that there is uncertainty in the time required to process (“mine”) new transactions on blockchains that use proof of work information.   You could broadcast the two transactions, meant for different blockchains, to <em>one</em> blockchain.  Why would this thwart every replay attack?  Remember that the ETH and ETC systems both have replay attack protection with regards to multiple transactions on the <em>same</em> blockchain.  One of the transactions should be accepted, and one rejected, on each blockchain.  No one can predict which of the two transactions will be accepted on either blockchain without also compromising mining nodes.  It may take multiple attempts, but, eventually funds will end up at different addresses on each system.</p>\\n<h1>Solutions Part Four</h1>\\n<p>Perceptive readers may also wonder whether new funds, sent to old addresses that previously held funds on both systems, are also vulnerable to replay attacks.  In some cases the answer is yes.  The simplest advice regarding that concern is to just avoid doing that.  In other words, do <em>not</em> reuse vulnerable addresses.  Arrange it so that no funds are ever sent to those addresses again.  If someone nevertheless insists on reusing addresses that exist on both chains, more work is required to secure future funds sent to those addresses.</p>\\n<h1>Parting Thoughts</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/83099acf43.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"coyote\\\"></p>\\n<p>Everyone must be vigilant about protecting their cryptocurrency.  Fortunately, there are effective tools and techniques that provide adequate safeguards.  The dangers cannot be ignored.  As an old Navajo proverb says:</p>\\n<p>“Coyote is always out there waiting, and Coyote is always hungry.”</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Therefore, when distributing information on a peer to peer network, it is desirable to minimize communications even if that implies adding computations.  Hashes can help confirm the integrity of information with minimal communication.  Hash trees, or Merkle trees, can also help <em>identify</em> invalid bits with minimal communication.</p>\\n<h1>El Paquete Semanal</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa6d5fc9.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"sign\\\"></p>\\n<p>To understand the importance of Merkle trees for blockchains, consider El Paquete Semanal (“the Weekly Package”), part of one of the strangest peer to peer networks in the world.  Every week a terabyte of YouTube videos, pop music MP3s, Spanish news articles and more is distributed to Cubans for a few pesos.  Distribution sometimes depends on such methods as passing hard drives around by hand.  This is because connectivity in Cuba is so poor.  95% of homes have none, and, the remaining 5% are subject to strong censorship. Suppose you wanted to give everyone a <em>perfect</em> copy of  El Paquete Semanal.  Because of the slowness of the network, it is impractical to resend copies to correct errors.  How would you quickly find and fix errors without resending many bits?  That is where Merkle trees come in.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa5e09b5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"house\\\"></p>\\n<h1>Fast Search</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa2df772.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"map\\\"></p>\\n<p>To understand why Merkle trees can be used to find errors so efficiently, try this activity: Have a friend pick any city in any part of the world. Google Maps might be helpful. Start asking yes / no questions to determine the city. You might ask questions like, “Is the city above or below the equator?”, and, “Is it to the east or west of Cairo?”. You should notice that cutting the search space approximately in half every question leads to the answer amazingly fast. Merkle trees allow a similarly fast search.</p>\\n<h1>Merkle Trees</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa48ed9d.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"merkle\\\"></p>\\n<p>Here is a Merkle tree recipe to quickly find corrupted segments in El Paquete Semanal:</p>\\n<p>Split it into eight segments and hash those segments. In the figure above, those eight hashes are represented by the boxes labelled 8 through 15. Then, hash consecutive <em>pairs</em> of those hashes. These are represented by the boxes labelled 4 through 7. Hash consecutive pairs of this second set of hashes as well.  These are represented by the boxes labelled 2 and 3.  Finally, hash these last two hashes. This is represented by the box labelled 1. Refer to the hash corresponding to label 1 as hash 1, the hash corresponding to label 2 as hash 2, etc.</p>\\n<p>Check hash 1 to determine if there are any errors to fix or not. Suppose the segment associated with hash 13 is corrupt. Check hashes 2 and 3 to determine the erroneous segment is associated with hash 6 or 7. Then, check hashes 6 and 7 to determine the bad segment is associated with hash 12 or 13. Finally, check hashes 12 and 13 to determine the faulty segment is associated with hash 13. Smaller segments would require a similar process with more levels to the Merkle tree.</p>\\n<p>For many small segments (lots of levels), using a Merkle tree to check and fix a remote copy requires much less communication than sending all the hashes of all the segments. It minimizes communications at the expense of some extra hash calculations.</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82fa22d881.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"last\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchain systems rely on many clever data structures and algorithms.  Merkle trees are muy importante for making blockchain systems operate quickly and efficiently.</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

In 2011 the group of hackers known as Anonymous executed DOS attacks against PayPal, MasterCard and Visa to protest their refusal to process WikiLeaks donations.  They claimed this was rightful protest and no different in principle than Occupy Wall Street.  DOS attacks may even be <em>governmental</em>.  Edward Snowden revealed that the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in the United Kingdom has developed DOS attack tools. Lastly, DOS attack vulnerabilities, without great effort, may be <em>undetectable</em>.  An address blacklist was proposed to deal with the Ethereum DAO attack.  Shortly thereafter, an overlooked DOS attack vulnerability was discovered with this scheme and the proposal was dropped.</p>\\n<h1>Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic Denial Of Service Attacks</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82ed206b72.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ethlogo\\\"></p>\\n<p>The recent DOS attacks against the Ethereum system started in September around the time of the developer conference in Shanghai. Vulnerabilities were exploited.  Vulnerabilities were later patched.  Then, new vulnerabilities would repeat the cycle over and over again. The attacker, or attackers, spent thousands of dollars to keep this going for several weeks. Eventually the Ethereum Classic system was also attacked in a similar manner.</p>\\n<p>Anyone can send large numbers of transactions to several Ethereum and Ethereum Classic nodes. Therefore, <em>anyone</em> can degrade these systems for the other participants <em>anytime</em>.  This is typically not done because it would be horrendously expensive to keep it up for very long. The current attacks were possible because some Ethereum and Ethereum Classic instructions were <em>underpriced</em> relative to the amount of resources they tied up. Examples include EXTCODESIZE, EXTCODECOPY, BALANCE, SLOAD, CALL, CALLDELEGATE, CALLCODE and SUICIDE. Some attack transactions cheaply invoked EXTCODESIZE tens of thousands of times!  Price adjustments to remove these vulnerabilities have necessitated changes to the systems (hard forks).</p>\\n<h1>Antifragility</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/82ed2780ed.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"antifrag\\\"></p>\\n<p>In the long term, these attacks might actually be <em>beneficial</em>.  The Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks are antifragile. Antifragility is the property of improving in response to stressors. Immune systems, bones, muscles, economies, theories and the mythological Hydra are antifragile. Every time a new attack is exposed, the developers eventually remove the vulnerability. Therefore, every attack makes the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems stronger!</p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Hard forks have caused more grief than probably anything else in the history of blockchains.  Additional hard forks are being discussed now by the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic communities to deal with issues caused by the recent denial of service attack spam. Fortunately, there is nothing problematic about the proposed hard forks.  I will describe an analogous technology and details of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems to show why all is well.</p>\\n<h1>Java Virtual Machine</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/ed6df2c02c.png\\\" alt=\\\"java\\\"></p>\\n<p>People own various computing devices.  People also run various versions and types of operating systems.  The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows disparate systems to all run programs and get the <em>exact</em> same results.  People have implemented the JVM in hardware, but, most just simulate it in software.  Some use compilers with no optimizations.  Some use “just in time” compilers.  Some use “ahead of time” compilers. Few care about the differences in JVM realizations as long as program results are <em>always</em> identical.  If a complex Java based weather simulation predicts the temperature in one week will be 78.91775159 °F, and all JVM instances also compute 78.91775159 °F, then everyone is happy.</p>\\n<h1>Ethereum &amp; Ethereum Classic Virtual Machines</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/0dbe7e221c.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"ETH\\\"></p>\\n<p>The Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems are also “virtual” machines.  They are imaginary machines that are <em>simulated</em>.  There is no Ethereum or Ethereum Classic world computer  located in a bunker somewhere.  The JVM allows everyone to effectively run programs on identical <em>clones</em> of a computer.  Astonishingly, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic allow everyone to effectively run programs on the same <em>instance</em> of a computer.  In other words, it is as if everyone is using the same single machine! As with the JVM, few care how this is done as long as the results are the same.  The recent denial of service attacks took advantage of the way the systems are currently simulated. The proposed hard forks will just improve the <em>efficiency</em>. All results will remain the same.</p>\\n<h1>More Details On The Proposed Hard Forks</h1>\\n<h4><strong><em>Ethereum attack contract account 0x7c20218efc2e07c8fe2532ff860d4a5d8287cb31 as of 2016-10-26 15:00:00 UTC that created over 2.4 million empty accounts:</em></strong></h4>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>FIELD</th>\\n<th>VALUE</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Ether Balance</td>\\n<td>0</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Contract Code</td>\\n<td>0x7f6004600c60003960046000f3600035ff00000000000000000000000…</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Storage Dictionary</td>\\n<td>(None)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Counter (Nonce)</td>\\n<td>34148</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The state of the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic systems at all times depends on all the previous activity.  Computations affect <em>accounts</em>.  There are <em>external</em> accounts and <em>contract</em> accounts. All accounts have four components: an ether balance, contract code, storage dictonary (associative array), and, a counter (nonce).  For external accounts, the counter tracks the submitted transactions.  For contract accounts, the counter tracks the created contracts. There is no reason for network nodes to store anything for accounts that either do not exist or are empty.  The attacks created millions of empty accounts that are using massive amounts of storage.  The proposed hard forks will just stop wasting space for these accounts.¹ As this storage is not in the blockchain, <strong>no changes to the blockchain are involved</strong>.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p><sub>1. Technically the proposed hard forks will also likely lead to slight gas costs to recreate these accounts.</sub></p>\\n<h1>Feedback</h1>\\n<p>Feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

The effect of this attack was effectively making both networks hardly usable: blockchain sync becoming extremely slow and halting unpredictably, valid transactions taking extremely long time to make it into a block, and full nodes (both parity and geth) crashing due to difficulties processing spam transactions bloat.</p>\\n<p>It turns out that the client code fixes can do only so much to protect the network from this type of attacks. In order to close the attack vector completely, a non-backwards-compatible change is needed that reprices some operations to better reflect their impact on the nodes and the network. Which can be done only through a hard fork.</p>\\n<p>From the very beginning of Ethereum Classic project, we made it clear that hard forks are only acceptable in order to correct protocol-level bugs, fix security vulnerabilities, and provide functionality upgrades, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. The gas reprice hard fork provides an important security fix and does not violate any principles that the Ethereum Classic community rallied around.</p>\\n<p>The technical details of the hard fork are expressed in <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/issues/17\\\">ECIP-1050</a> (<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/150\\\">EIP-150 for Ethereum</a>), and the fork code is currently being implemented and tested by ETC dev team.</p>\\n<p>It is important to note that ETH team chose another timeframe for hard fork implementation, to be effective on ETH block 2463000. Unfortunately, geth 1.4.18 released by Ethereum Foundation developers <strong>does not</strong> properly take --oppose-dao flag into consideration when implementing hard fork changes on block 2463000. Therefore, it becomes impossible to use this geth release as Ethereum Classic client.</p>\\n<p><strong>All ETC full node users and miners are advised to upgrade to either <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases\\\">Classic version of geth</a> or <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethcore/parity/releases/\\\">Parity</a> full node (which implements ETC hard fork properly) as soon as possible.</strong></p>\\n<p>Users of the light ETC wallets (such as <a href=\\\"https://jaxx.io/\\\">Jaxx</a>), <a href=\\\"http://classicetherwallet.com/\\\">web wallet</a> or <a href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classicetherwallet-cx/opggclcfcbfbchcienjdaohghcamjfhf\\\">Chrome extension</a> should not be affected. Your ETC located in the exchange accounts also should be safe through a hard fork transition. Mist or EthereumWallet users should use Parity or Classic geth as a backend, as explained <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peAnJ3rRn04\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h3>UPDATE: ETC community successfully implemented GasReprice hard fork</h3>\\n<p>Block 2,500,000 passed without any issues, and ETC GasReprice hard fork is now effective. There was no netsplit, and ETC nethash did not change in any significant way, as can be seen on ETCstats network monitor.</p>\\n<p>We appreciate continued support of ETC exchanges, wallets and mining pools who upgraded their infrastructure in a timely manner and contributed to a smooth transition through the hard fork event.</p>\\n<p>First Ethereum Classic hard fork is a significant milestone for ETC community. Congratulations to classic geth and parity developers on the successful implementation and testing of the hard fork code! Many community members distributed information about the fork, helped ETC users to upgrade or troubleshooted various infrastructure issues. Without your active involvement, such a smooth transition would not be possible. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>\\n<p>Follow Ethereum Classic Twitter and Reddit for more updates:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eth_classic\\\">https://twitter.com/eth_classic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic\\\">https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016-10-17-hard-fork.md\n ** module id = 418\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Instead of The Halvening, A Tithing for ETC\",\"date\":\"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Carlos Graterol\",\"body\":\"<p><img src=\\\"http://www.imaniafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/monetary.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Monetary policy\\\"></p>\\n<p>Since the beginning of the formation of the Ethereum Classic community, users, developers, miners, and traders have been pondering about a change in monetary policy for ETC. Though many users in ETC look forward to a future of decentralized applications and smart contracts running on the blockchain but are dissatisfied with the current supply schedule of 5 ETC awarded per block which is created on average every 14 seconds.</p>\\n<p>As of the time of this writing, the available supply of ETC stands at 85.4 Million coins in circulation and users can’t help but compare that to Bitcoin’s 15.96 Million. For every 1 BTC there are 5 ETC and Bitcoin is 7 years older! Ethereum started with a Pre-Mine of 72 Million and by 2055, if nothing is changed, there will be about 500 Million ETC.</p>\\n<h2>A Network Upgrade</h2>\\n<p>The current supply schedule for ETC is a bug, not a feature. A tightening of supply similar to Bitcoin’s would constitute as a network upgrade. The upward pressure on price due to the increased scarcity would encourage more mining, savings, and investment into ETC dApps and smart contracts.</p>\\n<p>The want and need for change in the money supply even had 77% support in one poll conducted by the Ethereum Classic Twitter Account.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/CUvJyj0.png\\\" alt=\\\"Monetary Policy Poll\\\"></p>\\n<p>Granted, it was not a scientific poll, but it seems to be an indicator of where the general ETC community stands on wanting to change policy.</p>\\n<h2>The Tithing Event</h2>\\n<p>Below are two <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5a8f5l/monetary_policy_analysis_help_doc_spreadsheet/\\\">proposals by user “Snaproll”</a> for changing the block reward of ETC. They are similar in nature to the supply schedule of Bitcoin which has proven to be a successful model were created with the goal of a CAP close to 210 million ETC. So that for every 1 BTC, there are roughly 10 ETC.</p>\\n<h3>Option A: “Tithing” at 10% Block Reward</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>10% Decrease in block reward every 3 million blocks.</li>\\n<li>3 million blocks is roughly 1.4 Years</li>\\n<li>Theoretical Max CAP at 222 million, CAP in reality closer to 210 million.</li>\\n<li>99% of ETC mined by 2071, CAP hit after 2164</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Option B: “Tithing” at 20% Block Reward.</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>20% Decrease in block reward every 6 million blocks.</li>\\n<li>6 million blocks is roughly 2.8 Years</li>\\n<li>Theoretical Max CAP at 222 million, CAP in reality closer to 210 million.</li>\\n<li>99% of ETC mined by 2066, CAP hit after 2157</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Out of the two proposals, I prefer “Option A.” The tithing at 10%, for the reason that a change in supply schedule is done on the same day as the “Freeze of the Difficulty Bomb” network upgrade at block 3 million. It sends a clear signal to the market that ETC has taken steps towards it’s long term future and place in the crypto-currency market.</p>\\n<p>Follow Ethereum Classic Twitter and Reddit for more updates on monetary policy:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/eth_classic\\\">https://twitter.com/eth_classic</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic\\\">https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./blog/2016-10-31-monetary-policy.md\n ** module id = 419\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"ETC Newsletter : 2016-10-24 - 2016-11-01\",\"date\":\"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\"author\":\"Carlo Vicari\",\"body\":\"<h2>Links</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ethereumclassic.github.io/\\\">ETC Website</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/\\\">ETC Reddit</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/eth_classic\\\">ETC Twitter</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/\\\">ETC Facebook</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ethereumclassic.herokuapp.com/\\\">ETC Slack</a></p>\\n<h2>ETC Development Report.</h2>\\n<p>With the recent protocol update complete, focus has now shifted towards monetary\\npolicy and governance models.

Information may be lost due to computer or human errors and corruption.  In 2014, half a <em>billion</em> Yahoo accounts were compromised.  Just a few months ago, the Air Force lost 12 <em>years</em> of investigative records.  Therefore, it continues to be problematic to trust companies and governments with information.</p>\\n<h1>Blockchains</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/8f27a142e5.png\\\" alt=\\\"blockchain\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchains are decentralized, secure, reliable and convenient databases.  Nobody trusts anybody and no one is in charge.  Nevertheless, blockchains are still used to store valuable assets including life savings and land titles.</p>\\n<p>Blockchain asset information is stored in records referred to as <em>transactions</em>.  Transactions are organized into <em>blocks</em> which are further organized into <em>chains</em>.  Cryptographic tools such as hashing functions and digital signatures help provide security.  For additional security, to add new blocks, people must compute results referred to as <em>proof of work information</em>.  To encourage this, calculation of proof of work information leads to cryptocurrency rewards.  People that compete to compute proof of work information, and receive cryptocurrency rewards, are referred to as <em>miners</em>.</p>\\n<h1>A Weird Analog</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/929126b195.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"smith\\\"></p>\\n<p>For an analog to blockchain systems, consider free market economies.  In free markets, goods and services are not in general managed by <em>anyone</em>.  Like blockchain systems, they are decentralized.  Interestingly, free market economies work better than controlled economies.  Adam Smith noticed, over 200 years ago, that individuals pursuing their own interests often benefit society more so than if they intentionally tried to benefit society.  It is as if every man is, in the words of Adam Smith, “led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.”  Likewise, unmanaged blockchain systems work better than managed database systems for some applications.</p>\\n<h1>Competition Is Foundational</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"http://i.imgsafe.org/8f298eaef5.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"trading\\\"></p>\\n<p>Free market economies work so well largely because of competition.  Competition improves productivity, efficiency, quality and more.  Likewise, competition is foundational to blockchain systems.  Widespread competition in mining provides resilience and security.  Free market economies are threatened when competition is dimished, such as when monopolies form.  Blockchain systems are threatened when a miner controls a majority of the mining resources (51% attack).</p>\\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgsafe.org/95d3b10b77.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"dali\\\"></p>\\n<p>Blockchain systems are able to effectively manage information in a trustless manner.  They are able to do this partly by utilizing the power of competition.  If blockchains seem unbelievable, consider that many are <em>still</em> skeptical of  free markets for similar reasons.
