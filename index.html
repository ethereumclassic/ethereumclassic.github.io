<h2>
<a id="ideology" class="anchor" href="#ideology" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ideology</h2>

<p>We believe in decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless blockchains. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone. </p>

<h2>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>Ethereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (diligently hidden, pro-fork) coin vote on <a href="http://carbonvote.com/">Carbonvote</a>, 19% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners voted against the previous 'DAO softfork' and would logically oppose hardfork as well. Such a significant minority of stakeholders should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a clear choice. </p>

<p>If we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized applications that are actually censorship resistant.</p>

<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal of the project is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.</p>

<h3>
<a id="development" class="anchor" href="#development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development</h3>

<p>We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow <a href="http://github.com/ethereum">http://github.com/ethereum</a> development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.</p>

<p>If you feel strongly about the cause, please get involved. We need your support to ensure original Ethereum will be kept alive. We need more developers, website designers, people who can write and advocate the need for Ethereum Classic. Please let us know what are your skills and how you would like to contribute. Redditors, please <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4sxupj/making_sure_original_ethereum_survives_please_get/">reply here</a>. Github users, please <a href="http://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/new">open new issue</a>.</p>

<p>In order to remain on the original Ethereum chain, just don't upgrade to hardfork client version pushed by Ethereum Foundation. We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.</p>

<p>Fun fact. Everyone who had legacy ETH in your wallet pre-fork, now has an extra 'bonus': you have the same amount of classic ethers (ETC) on the same address. If you install Ethereum Classic client (better on a separate computer), you can use your coins on both chains! Just follow this advice to <a href="https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/3">separate your legacy funds cleanly and avoid replay attack</a>. If you held ETH balances with major exchanges: Bitfinex, Poloniex, Kraken, you have good news: they are going to assign you an equal amount ETC post-fork! </p>

<h3>
<a id="miners" class="anchor" href="#miners" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Miners</h3>

<p>Miners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from <a href="http://github.com/ethereumclassic">http://github.com/ethereumclassic</a>. </p>

<p>The difficulty bump after the fork was huge, but overall the separation of the networks went smoothly. Our miners stood strong and prevailed against long odds. We are past the initial difficulty bump, nethash is about 30GH, making Ethereum Classic one of the most secure blockchains (for comparison, original Ethereum started with just 16GH last August). Time between blocks is back to normal, network stable and ready for business. Mining is becoming sustainable, even solo miners have a chance to make a classic block or two. It is now possible to obtain decent mining rewards in classic ethers from mining. Join in on the fun! </p>

<p>We have mining pools supporting Ethereum Classic: </p>

<a id="traders" class="anchor" href="#traders" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Traders</h3>

<p>Most important question for traders is 'will ETC have market price'? There are all reasons to believe that it will. Essentially, ETC is an Ethereum <a href="http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0">'spinoff coin'</a> with a wide user base of all current ETH users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won't. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. Additional reasoning why <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5dawgg">EHTC is very unlikely to be 'worthless'</a>.</p>

<p>All the major exchanges announced that they will assign their users both ETH and ETC after the fork. This is a step in the right direction, now it's up to these major exchanges to enable ETH/ETC trading that will no doubt be demanded by users. Decentralized exchange Bitsquare started <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4t30qf/bitsquare_will_add_ethc_trading_immediately/">ETC trading right after the fork</a>. Other trading venues will follow since there is a strong business case. We are in touch with several other exchanges to add ETC trading to their platforms. If your exchange is interested in ETC trading, please <a href="mailto:bitnovosti@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>
