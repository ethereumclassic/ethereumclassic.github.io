## Why Classic?

Ethereum Classic is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run **exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference**.

Ethereum Classic is a continuation of the original [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain - the classic 'unforked' version; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions.
