We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer you can't shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks are only possible in order to correct actual platform bugs, not to bail out failed contracts and special interests. We believe in censorship-resistant platform that can be actually trusted - by anyone. \r\n \r\nMore: http://medium.com/@bit_novosti/a-crypto-decentralist-manifesto-6ba1fa0b9ede\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nEthereum Foundation responded to DAO debacle in the worst way possible. Special interests controlling the Foundation are ramming through DAO bailout hardfork against principled opposition of a significant economic minority of Ethereum stakeholders. According to (diligently hidden, pro-fork) coin vote on [Carbonvote](http://carbonvote.com/), 19% of ETH holders oppose this hardfork. Also, about 22% of Ethereum miners voted against the previous 'DAO softfork' and would logically oppose hardfork as well. Such a significant minority of stakeholders should not be silenced or intimidated into submission - they should be given a clear choice. \r\n\r\nIf we want to continue to move forward and guarantee survival of the original Ethereum vision, we must fork Ethereum. This will lay the foundation to build secure decentralized applications that are actually censorship resistant.\r\n\r\nMore: http://github.com/ethereumclassic/freeworldcomputer-project\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the project is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nWe fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow http://github.com/ethereum development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.\r\n\r\nCode: http://github.com/ethereumclassic\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\n* http://www.ethereumclassic.org\r\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/\r\n\r\n## What can I do?\r\n\r\nPlease help us spread the word about this project in Ethereum community! \r\n\r\n### Volunteers\r\nIf you feel strongly about the cause, please get involved. With just days before the planned hardfork, we need your support to ensure original Ethereum survival. We need more developers, website designers, people who can write and advocate the need for Ethereum Classic. Please let us know what are your skills and how you would like to contribute. Redditors, please [reply here](http://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4sxupj/making_sure_original_ethereum_survives_please_get/). Github users, please [open new issue](http://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/new).\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nIn order to remain on the original Ethereum chain, just don't upgrade to hardfork client version pushed by Ethereum Foundation. We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.\r\n\r\nFun fact. If you keep ETH under your direct control (not in a 3rd party wallet or exchange account), you will have **two** sets of coins instead of one post-fork. You could then install a forked Ethereum client in addition to Ethereum Classic, copy your private keys there and use your coins on both chains! You won't be so lucky if your ETH are locked with 3rd party going into the fork - some exchanges [already announced](http://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sy7w6/breaking_kraken_on_the_july_20th_ethereum/) that they will only return one type of coin post-fork to its users.\r\n\r\n### Miners\r\n\r\nMiners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from http://github.com/ethereumclassic. \r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the original chain will be quite high post-fork, but it will adjust to actual hashrate shortly (just 2048 blocks, a few hours). Since it is expected that most hashrate will move to hardfoked chain, post-adjustment it will be possible to obtain decent mining rewards in classic ethers even with solo mining.\r\n\r\nWe have mining pool supporting Ethereum Classic: http://ethc.epool.io. Because the difficulty adjusts quickly, it will be also quite possible to solo mine soon after the fork. If you intend to mine Ethereum Classic, please **don't upgrade to geth 1.4.10** just yet, due to [potential vulnerability](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4ti33y/classic_miners_please_use_geth_149/). We will inform you when it's safe to upgrade. For now, just solo-mine with geth 1.4.9 or any earlier version, or use Classic pool.\r\n\r\n### Traders\r\n\r\nMost important question for traders is 'will ETHC have market price'? There are all reasons to believe that it will. Essentially, ETHC is an Ethereum ['spinoff coin'](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0) with a wide user base of all current ETH users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won't. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. Additional reasoning why [EHTC is very unlikely to be 'worthless'](http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5dawgg).\r\n\r\nBoth Poloniex a Bitfinex announced that they will assign their users both ETH and ETHC after the fork. This is a step in the right direction, now it's up to these major exchanges to enable ETH/ETHC trading that will no doubt be demanded by users. Decentralized exchange Bitsquare announced [ETHC trading right after the fork](http://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4t30qf/bitsquare_will_add_ethc_trading_immediately/). Other trading venues will follow since there is a strong business case. We are in touch with several other exchanges to add ETHC trading to their platforms. If your exchange is interested in ETHC trading, please [contact us](mailto:bitnovosti@gmail.com).\r\n\r\n#### Let's make sure original Ethereum vision doesn't just \"go gentle into that good night\"!",
