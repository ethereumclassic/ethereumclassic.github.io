## Priority Breakdown

### üî¥ HIGH Priority (User Funds at Risk)

**Total Files:** 2  
**Total Links:** 209 (34.5% of all links)

| File | Links | Risk Factor |
|------|-------|-------------|
| content/services/exchanges/index.yaml | 153 | Users trade/buy ETC here |
| content/services/wallets/index.yaml | 56 | Users store funds here |

**Why HIGH:** Users directly interact with these services for financial transactions. Dead links could lead users to scam sites or prevent access to legitimate services.

**Last Updated:** 2-3 years ago  
**Recommendation:** Verify IMMEDIATELY

### üü° MEDIUM Priority (Service Infrastructure)

**Total Files:** 4  
**Total Links:** 189 (31.2% of all links)

| File | Links | Risk Factor |
|------|-------|-------------|
| content/development/tooling/index.yaml | 73 | Developers use these tools |
| content/mining/pools/index.yaml | 59 | Miners earn income here |
| content/community/channels/index.yaml | 42 | Community engagement |
| content/network/endpoints/index.yaml | 15 | Infrastructure access |

**Why MEDIUM:** Important for ecosystem participants but not directly handling user funds.

**Recommendation:** Verify within 1-2 weeks

### üü¢ LOW Priority (Reference/Historical)

**Total Files:** 13  
**Total Links:** 207 (34.2% of all links)

**Why LOW:** Mostly reference material, historical links, or less critical resources. Still should be verified but not urgent.

**Recommendation:** Verify within 1-2 months

## High-Risk Services Requiring Verification

Services identified with high probability of being defunct:

### Category: Wallets

| Service | URL | Risk Factor |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Midas Protocol | https://midasprotocol.io/ | DeFi protocol from 2020-2021 |
| Now Wallet | https://walletnow.app/ | Low brand recognition |
| Ownbit | https://ownbit.io/ | Unclear status |
| Button Wallet | https://buttonwallet.com/ | Single-purpose, may have pivoted |
| Hebe Core | https://hebecore.com/ | Maintenance status unclear |

### Category: Exchanges

| Service | URL | Risk Factor |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| eToroX | https://www.etorox.com/ | May have consolidated with eToro |
| Tidex | https://tidex.com/ | Small exchange, status unclear |
| FatBTC | https://www.fatbtc.com/ | Low visibility |
| CAT.EX | https://www.catex.io/ | Small exchange |

### Category: Hardware Products

| Service | URL | Risk Factor |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| BillFodl | https://billfodl.com/ | Company status unclear |
| Blockplate | https://www.blockplate.com/ | Status unclear |
| ColdTi | https://coldti.com/ | Niche product |
| Crypto Key Stack | https://cryptokeystack.com/ | Status unclear |
| Hodlinox | https://hodlinox.com/ | Status unclear |
| Steely | https://thesteely.com/ | Status unclear |

### Category: Communication

| Service | URL | Risk Factor |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Gitter | https://gitter.im/core-geth/community | Platform deprecated/merged |
| Heroku Slack | https://ethereumclassic.herokuapp.com/ | ‚úÖ FIXED - Heroku free tier ended |

**Total High-Risk:** ~30-40 services  
**Status:** Documented, awaiting verification

## Network Limitation Impact

### Blocked Verification

Due to CI environment network restrictions, the following types of links could NOT be automatically verified:

| Domain Type | Example | Count (est.) | Impact |
|-------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| Social Media | twitter.com, facebook.com | ~50 | Cannot verify accounts |
| Communication | discord.gg, t.me | ~30 | Cannot test invites |
| Exchanges | Most crypto exchanges | ~150 | Cannot verify listings |
| Wallets | Most wallet services | ~50 | Cannot test downloads |
| Other Services | Various | ~325 | Cannot verify status |

**Total Unverified:** 605 links (100%)  
**Reason:** DNS resolution fails for external domains in CI environment

### Verification Method Required

Since automated checking is blocked, verification must use one of these methods:

1. **Local Execution** (Recommended)
   - Run `node scripts/check-dead-links.js` locally
   - Full internet access
   - ~15 minutes execution time

2. **Manual Verification**
   - Check each link in browser
   - Time intensive
   - ~6 hours for all links

3. **Community Crowdsourcing**
   - Post list to Discord
   - Ask users to verify services they use
   - Combine community reports

## Suspicious Patterns Identified

Patterns that suggest potential dead links:

| Pattern | Count | Examples | Risk Level |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| Heroku free apps | 1 | ‚úÖ Fixed | Confirmed |
| Gitter links | 1 | gitter.im | High |
| Old DeFi protocols | 5+ | .io domains from 2020-2021 | Medium-High |
| Generic wallet names | 5+ | "Now Wallet", etc | Medium |
| Hardware startups | 7+ | BillFodl, Blockplate | Medium |
| Small exchanges | 10+ | Regional/low volume | Medium |
| Outdated .io domains | 20+ | Various | Low-Medium |
