  ## What is Ethereum Classic?

  Ethereum Classic is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that can be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, or third party interference.

  Ethereum Classic consists of a cryptocurrency (ETC), a blockchain ledger, and an [ecosystem](/ecosystem) of applications and services that run on top of it.

  Put simply, Ethereum Classic provides a way to manage digital assets without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other financial institutions.

  ETC allows uncensorable smart contracts to be written, deployed and executed; it enables truly unstoppable programmable money.

  Ethereum Classic is the continuation of the *original* non-forked Ethereum (ETH) chain and exists to preserve the principle of "code is law".

  To find out more about ETC's history and where it's going, check out the [Ethereum Classic roadmap](/knowledge/roadmap).
