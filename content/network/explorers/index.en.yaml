title: Blockchain Explorers
description: |
  Blockchain Explorers provide a convenient way to get insights into the current and past state of a given chain, allowing you to inspect the contents of blocks, transactions and account balances. 

  They are commonly used to check that transactions have been confirmed properly, but many offer more advanced features such as historical account balances, contract verification, and more.
