  title: Build Unstoppable Applications
  content: |
    As incumbent institutions are increasingly threatened by the wild potential of blockchain tech, only truly decentralized and secure cryptocurrencies will survive.

    Existing in response to uphold and preserve the principle of *Code is Law*, Ethereum Classic (ETC) has proven its ability to resist censorship against all the odds, and to deliver the *original* Ethereum vision of *unstoppable* applications.

    By combining the technology of Ethereum™ (ETH) with the philosophy of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC) is uniquely positioned to be the base layer smart contracts platform of the future, as other chains become compromised or captured by special interests. 

    Welcome, and please be invited to discover the past, present, and future of Ethereum Classic; its principles, value proposition, community, and more - to understand *why Classic*.
