      ## What is Ethereum Classic?

      Ethereum Classic is a decentralized computing platform that executes smart contracts. Applications are ran exactly as programmed without the possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference.

      Ethereum Classic is a distributed network consisting of a blockchain ledger, native cryptocurrency (ETC) and robust [ecosystem](/ecosystem) of on-chain applications and services.

      Ethereum Classic provides a permissionless way to manage digital assets without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other institutions.

      Ethereum Classic allows uncensorable smart contracts to be written, deployed and executed; ETC enables truly unstoppable programmable money.

      Ethereum Classic is the continuation of *the unaltered history* of **the original Ethereum chain**. The ETC network exists to preserve the principle of "[Code is Law](/blog/2016-09-09-code-is-law)".

      To learn more about Ethereum Classic's formative history and ETC's promising future, check out the project's [roadmap](/knowledge/roadmap).
