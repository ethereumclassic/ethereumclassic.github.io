title: Development Teams
meta: A list of major organizations that previously or are currently contributing to Ethereum Classic
description: |
  Ethereum Classic is a decentralized development ecosystem which means there is no 'official' team or formal hierarchy. This global development community is a permissionless 'do-ocracy', where anyone can participate. Individuals and teams choose tasks for themselves and execute them. We collectively establish [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) through the [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP)](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) process.

  This is a list of prominent teams that have contributed to Ethereum Classic since the project's genesis block on July 30, 2015. The Ethereum Classic ecosystem is appreciative of all protocol level development efforts by individuals, volunteers, and teams.
