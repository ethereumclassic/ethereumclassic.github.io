On top of the Ethereum Classic blockchain is a rich ecosystem of applications, including Wallets, Exchanges and Decentralized Applications. As the number of these services grows over time, so does the utility and value of the network as a whole.

## Important Warning

Ethereum Classic, as a neutral permissionless protocol, has no means to gate-keep what is deployed to it, so the only protection users have against falling victim to bad projects is vigilance and a level of prudence, making sure that what they are interacting with has a level of integrity they are comfortable with.

Where it is relevant, this section will try to provide some hints as to what are signs of a good project. The _gold standard_ is a team with a track record publishing open source code with a full test suite and extensive audits, but it is up to individuals to decide for themselves what level of assurance they need depending on their use case, financial commitment, and risk appetite.

Even _gold standard_ projects will occasionally fall victim to bugs, hacks and rugpulls, so always follow the first rule of crypto: **don't invest what you can't afford to lose**.

All the links to external resources on the website should be treated with caution, as they are community submitted, are not vetted, and cannot be guaranteed to be safe.

Please take precautions and do your own research before using an application.
