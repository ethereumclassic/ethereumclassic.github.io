  description: Wrapped Ether (WETC) is a tokenized version of Ether (ETC), the native asset of the Ethereum Classic network. The Canonical Wrapped Ether (WETC) Initiative deployed a WETC contract that follows modern best practices in Solidity since version 0.5+. This smart contract is a public good that standardizes the WETC asset throughout the DeFi stack on Ethereum Classic. If you're developing on Ethereum Classic and neet to wrap ETC into an ERC20 asset, please implement this public good contract to improve the UX for ETC network users.
