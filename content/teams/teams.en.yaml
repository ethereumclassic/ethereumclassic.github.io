  # Teams

  The Ethereum Classic ecosystem is decentralized and doesn't have a formal hierarchy; it's a permissionless 'do-ocracy', where anyone can participate. Individuals and teams choose tasks for themselves and execute them.

  This page contains a selection of the prominent teams who are actively contributing to the ETC ecosystem.

  ETC is growing and now is a great time to get involved in an important and unique blockchain project! If you'd like to contribute, a good place to start is to reach out to one of the teams below. You can also join the [discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/HW4GckH).
etcLabs: ETC Labs
etcLabsText: |
  ETC Labs provides funding, industry connections, and office space to burgeoning ETC projects; with office space in San Francisco and Singapore. Their long-term goal is to accelerate the development of the Ethereum Classic community & ecosystem.

  The ETC Labs Core team will be focused on core Ethereum Classic projects, supporting the ETC blockchain, providing tooling for decentralized application development, mining, and services. In pursuit of their mission, they value state immutability, decentralization, and backward compatibility.
etcCore: ETC Core
etcCoreText: |
  ETC Core is the leading Ethereum Classic core development team.

  From fundamental specifications, tooling suites, and resources, they deliver open-source tooling for the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. They strongly believe in cross-chain compatability and implement that philosophy in their projects. You can use many of their tools on any EVM-based blockchain.

  They actively support the long term development of the ETC protocol. They do this by championing improvement specifications to adoption and maintaining Multi-Geth.

  They are commited to maximizing the capabilities of the EthereumStack through their EVM-LLVM project and compiler improvement initiatives.
etcCoop: ETC Cooperative
etcCoopText: |
  > The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) was created to financially support the growth and development of Ethereum Classic by funding three key aspects of the ETC ecosystem: development, marketing, and community. To that end they serve as a liason between various teams, maintain community-based software, and reach out to members of other Ethereum-based communities.
chainsafe: ChainSafe

  > ChainSafe is a team of Developers and nerds focused on solving their clients problems utilizing blockchain technology wherever possible. Developers with interests in blockchains, augmented reality and the sharing economy (p2p networks). Helping to build Web3 for a better world.</p>
iohk: IOHK (Grothendieck)
iohkText: |
  > Named after a leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry, the IOHK Grothendieck Team is a motivated group of math and science-driven engineers and developers. At the forefront of team’s development is Mantis, a node client built from scratch using Scala, a functional programming language. Mantis easily connects to the IOHK Daedalus Wallet UI, allowing users to easily manage their ETC. The team’s focus is to securely and methodically establish a strong ETC ecosystem, with a solid foundation and immutability at its core.
