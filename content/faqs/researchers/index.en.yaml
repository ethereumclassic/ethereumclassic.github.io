      what:
        question: What is Ethereum Classic?
        answer: |
          Ethereum Classic is a Proof of Work Smart Contract Blockchain.

          Philosophically, ETC is similar to Bitcoin, valuing the ideals of decentralization, censorship resistance and sound money. Technologically, it is similar to Etheruem, operating an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

          Combinging these two approaches puts Ethereum Classic in a unqiue position, providing a storng decentralist foundation rooted in cypherpunk ideals along with the flexibility and innovation of Smart Contracts.
      eth:
        question: What is the difference between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum?
        answer: |
          Ethereum Classic and Ethereum were once the same project, but due to a difference in philosophy, the communities split in 2016. In 2022, Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake, with Classic remaining on Proof of Work. This marked the first major technological difference between the two chains.

          Apart from their consensus mechanisms, ETC and ETH remain very similar technologically, and ETC maintains EVM compatability so that contracts deployed to Ethereum can also be easily deployed to Ethereum Classic.

          You can learn more about the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in the [history](/knowledge/history) and [geneis](/why-classic/genesis) sections.
      whitepaper:
        question: Does Ethereum Classic have a whitepaper?
        answer: |
          Because Ethereum is a fork of Ethereum Classic, both projects share the same history up until 2016, including preceeding documents such as the Ethereum [Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) and [Yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

          After the split with Ethereum, ETC supporters published a number of documents detailing differences in philosophy, which became part of the Ethereum Classic project's DNA. You can read more about Ethereum Classic's founding documents in the [foundation](/knowledge/foundation) section.
      roadmap:
        question: Where can I find Ethereum Classic's roadmap?
        answer: |
          Similar to Bitcoin, as a decentralized project without top-down leadership, there is no formal executive road map. The protocal is continuously improved through grassroots collaboration through the [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal](/development/ecips) (ECIP) process.

          You can find more about potential upgrades in the [future](/knowledge/future) section.
      origins:
        question: Why does Ethereum Classic exist?
        answer: |
          The mission of Ethereum Classic is to continue the original Ethereum vision of "Build Unstoppable Applications" embodied in the ideal of "Code is Law".

          On a technical level, Ethereum Classic exists as a continuation of Ethereum, which split away from ETC in 2016 and by stopping the execution of an application running on it. You can learn about the details of this event in [geneis](/why-classic/genesis) section.
      codeIsLaw:
        question: What does "Code is Law" mean?
        answer: |
          "Code is Law" is an ideal whereby no authority has the ability to interfere with the operations of valid contracts and transactions on-chain, enabling many promising benefits that have the potential to vastly improve the state of the world.

          The alternative, "Code isn't Law", has been the standard state of affairs before the dawn of blockchain technology, whereby corruptible off-chain decision making processes determine the result of contracts and transactions. 

          You can learn more more about the nuance of this concept in the [Code is Law](/why-classic/code-is-law) section.
      decentralization:
        question: Why should I care about decentralization?
        answer: |
          Decentralization is a pre-requisit for "Code is Law". It allows participants to operate on a level palying field, and is what unlocks the fundamental value of blockchain technology. Many blockchain projects, despite their claims, are not sufficiently decentralized, making them suceptible to capture and censorship.

          You can learn more about this in the [decentralism](/why-classic/decentralism) section.
      who:
        question: Who is in charge of the Ethereum Classic Project?
        answer: |
          Similar to Bitcoin, no single entity is in charge of the Etheruem Classic Project. Instead, individuals and teams following a common set of principles contribute in a permissionless grassroots do-ocracy. While this organizational structure has some drawbacks, it also makes the project immune to certain types of capture and therefore enhances long-term survival.

          There is therefore no top-down leadership and "no official anything" in ETC, including this website and even the Ethereum Classic client software. Nontheless, there are prominant teams that operate within the ecosystem, gaining informal influence based on their reputation, track record, and contributions.

          You can learn more about Ethereum Classic's self-organizing communtiy in the [community](/community) and [foundation](/knowledge/foundation) sections.
      proofOfWork:
        question: Why doesn't Ethereum Classic use Proof of Stake?
        answer: |
          As Ethereum Classic puts a high priority on censorship resistance, it's community decided to remain on the tried and true Proof of Work consensus mechanism. There are many reasons why the various flavors of Proof of Stake are not able to match the same security guaruntees as PoW, but in short, they all involve security or decentralization trade-offs that make them more suceptable to censorship.

          You can learn more about the decision for Ethereum Classic no to switch to Proof of Stake in the [Proof of Work](/why-classic/proof-of-work) section.
      stats:
        question: How can I find out about Ethereum Classic's network status?
        answer: |
          You can find information about the health and state of ETC in the [network monitors](/network/monitors) and [blockchain explorer](/network/explorers) sections, as well as price information on various [exchanges](/services/exchanges).

          Notably, the website [etc-network.info](https://etc-network.info/) maintains a number of monitoring services.
      news:
        question: How can I keep up to date on ETC happenings?
        answer: |
          The [News](/news) section is regularly updated with important news and community blog posts, where you can also find an RSS feed.

          There are also many sources of updates available from community [Social Channels](/community/channels). Notably, the Ethereum Classic community [Discord Server](https://ethereumclassic.org/discord) and [/r/ethereumclassic](https://reddit.com/r/ethereumclassic). 

          You can also follow development updates in the [Ethereum Classic Github](https://github.com/ethereumclassic) and [ETC Labs Github](https://github.com/etclabscore) organizations.
