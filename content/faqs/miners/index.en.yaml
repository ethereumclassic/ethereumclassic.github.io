      hardware:
        question: What hardware do I need to mine ETC?
        answer: |
          The two main hardware categories that can be used to mine Etheruem Classic are GPUs and ASICs, and within each category there are many options. You can find a short guide about how to decide what to use in the [mining hardware](/mining/hardware) section.
      software:
        question: What software can I use to mine ETC?
        answer: |
          Depending on your operating system, there are a number of options available. Check out the [mining software](/mining/software) to find the right tools for you. You also find video tutorials online by searching "How to mine Etheruem Classic".
      pools:
        question: What is a mining pool?
        answer: |
          As Ethereum Classic enjoys a large hashrate, it is very unlikely that a small solo miner will be lucky enough to mine a block on their own. For this reason, unless you have a large mining operation, solo miners usually join a mining pool to recevie a smaller more regular rewards, proportional to the hashrate they contribute.
      poolsList:
        question: Which mining pools support ETC?
        answer: |
          You can find a list of pools that support Ethereum Classic in the [mining pools](/mining/pools) section, and metrics on the size of these pools in the [network monitors](/network/monitors) sectoin.
      schedule:
        question: Is it profitable to mine ETC?
        answer: |
          Ethereum Classic is currently the largest GPU-minable cryptocurrency in terms of net revenue, with the largest total USD value of block rewards.

          As with all cryptocurrency mining operations, whether or not your can make a profit depends on a number of factors, such as hardware efficiency and scale, but is largely determined by the cost of electricity in your local area.

          Some users may decide to mine at a loss, as it enables them to acquire "fresh" ETC for transactions that do not have any provenance.
      ethash:
        question: What is Etheruem Classic's mining algorithm?
        answer: |
          Etheruem Classic uses the [ETCHash](#TODO) mining algorithm, a close cousin of Ethereum's ETHash, with a smaller DAG size. Hardware that was being used used to mine pre-merge ETH can also be used to mine ETC.
      emission:
        question: What is the Ethereum Classic block reward?
        answer: |
          Presently the main source of revenue for miners comes from the fixed base beward, as outlined in ECIP-1017. Every 5 million blocks, this reward is reduced by 20%, in a similar way to Bitcoin's halvening.

          There are also 3 additional sources of revenue that miners sould take into consideration when calculating profitability, which largely depend on network usage:

          - Transaction Fees, which depends on network conjestion
          - Uncle Rate, TODO
          - MEV (Miner Extractable Value)
      asics:
        question: Is Ethereum Classic's mining algorithm ASIC resitant?
        answer: |
          ETHash was originally designed to be memory-difficult, with the goal of making the use of ASICs (such as those designed for Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm) non viable.

          With time, it was realized that [there is no such thing as ASIC resistance](#TODO). Eventually all mining algorithms, if profitable, will create an incentive for chip designers to come up with optimizations for that specific algorithm, which happened for ETHash (and was inherited by ETCHash). 

          As of 2022, ASICs are available that can mine ETCHash 2x to 6x more energy efficiently than GPUs, and is likely that this trend will continue.
      rewards:
        question: What percentage of ETC's block reward goes to miners?
        answer: |
          100%. Unlike many other projects, which have a % of block rewards going to a centralized treasury system, ETC remains fully neutral in this regard. In 2021 a [treasury proposal](#TODO) like this was rejected by the ETC community.
      sha3:
        question: Is Ethereum Classic is switching it's mining algorithm to SHA3?
        answer: |
          Very unlikely at this point. 

          Before Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake, there was ongoing debate about ETC switching to SHA3, partly to defend from "The Flood" of latent hashrate that could be used to 51% attack the chain post-merge. 

          Since The Merge, far from being attacked, ETC has instead become the "apex predator" of the ETHash family of mining algorithms, making it far more difficult to 51% attack. Switching to a completely new SHA3 algorithm would sacrifice this secure position and is no longer being actively being debated.
      pos:
        question: Will ETC switch to Proof of Stake in the future?
        answer: |
          It's essentially impossible.

          While any change to Ethereum Classic is technically *possible*, a switch to Proof of Stake is practically untennable, as a consensus has formed around Proof of Work's superiority in terms of censorship resistance. Any proposal to introduce Proof of Stake on Ethereum Classic would at first be ridiculed, and if forced into the client code, would cause a chain split resulting in two chains. Whatever happens, there will be a version of Ethereum Classic that remained on Proof of Work, making attempts to implement PoS largely fruitless.

          You can read more in the [Proof of Work](/why-classic/proof-of-work) section.
