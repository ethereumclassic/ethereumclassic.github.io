  shortText: Meet fellow participants
  text: There is NO OFFICIAL ANYTHING. Ethereum Classic is an open-source, decentralized project with a global permissionless ecosystem. Ethereum Classic's history is checkered with attempts at social attacks on the Ethereum Classic network and it's assets or commons (e.g.; code repository, website, brand, network history). We see similar social engineering in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It's a negative externality that comes with a truly decentralized project. As there's no official channels, you'll notice Ethereum Classic has a variety of different channels to discuss everything related to ETC. These channels are maintained by ETC participants and usually focus on a specific region or topic. Search the list and join the Ethereum Classic social channels that interest you!
