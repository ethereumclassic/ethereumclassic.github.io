seo: A history of past hard forks; the protocol upgrades that were accepted for Ethereum Classic.
description: |
  Ethereum Classic, despite its history, is not against all types of Hard Fork. Far from it; Hard Forking allows the protocol to be upgraded, to fix bugs, and add features that further the goal of enabling developers to "Build Unstoppable Applications".

  The types of Hard Fork that Ethereum Classic will never implement are those like [The DAO Fork](/why-classic/genesis), which do not address a defect in or enhancement of the protocol itself, but instead override *Code is Law* by modifying Smart Contracts in the application layer.

  Ethereum Classic strategically maintains maximal compatibility with upstream Ethereum's EVM, which means contracts deployed to ETH can also be deployed to ETC, and Ethereum Classic inherits many valuable innovations born through research on Ethereum.

        text: Launched under the slogan "Build Unstoppable Applications", Frontier was a live, but barebones implementation of the Ethereum project. It followed the successful Olympic testing phase. It was intended for technical users, specifically developers. Blocks had a gas limit of 5,000. This ‘thawing’ period enabled miners to start their operations and for early adopters to install their clients without having to ‘rush’.
