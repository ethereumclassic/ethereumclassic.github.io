**ETC** aka **Ethereum Classic** has a number of meanings depending on usage:

- ETC also refers to the *native currency*, or *base token* of the Ethereum Classic Blockchain, commonly traded under the ETC ticker symbol on exchanges
- In a technical context, ETC is also known as Ether or Wei

ETC is "digital money" that can be sent over the internet instantly and cheaply, and also be used in Ethereum Classic applications.

## How do I get ETC?

### Purchase ETC

The easiest way to get ETC is to buy some. There are many cryptocurrency exchanges that will allow you to buy ETC, but the one you should use will depend on where you live and how you want to pay.

### Mining for ETC

More technically advanced users may acquire ETC by allocating computer resources to support the Ethereum Classic network. This method is commonly referred to as "mining" for block rewards.
