### ECIP-1096 Bitcoin Merged Mining Presentation

We present a proposal for ETC to use blocks mined with SHA-256 in Bitcoin to detect blockchain branches that have been mined in private and rise alarms that can prevent double-spend attacks. The proposal enables full nodes to take local decision to prevent certain attacks, but also the existence of a public view of the different competing ETC branches enables the use a Fork Monitoring System that can provide more detailed alerts to full nodes and to the community.

### Goals

Following the recommendations of representatives of other teams (mostly IOHK) and requests from community members, we decided to organize a live Q&A session. The goal of this call is to get contributors, community members, stakeholders and other teams who have created similar proposals to ask questions as needed to properly understand this proposal.

### Q&A

Questions must be submitted to this [issue comment thread](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/343) or directly at ETC Discord.
