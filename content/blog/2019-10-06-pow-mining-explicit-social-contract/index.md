## Introduction

In the years since the DAO fork and the unexpected
birth of Ethereum Classic, strong social
consensus has emerged in support of ETC remaining
POW mined into the indefinite future.

In order for Ethereum Classic to remain
self-sovereign, merge-mining ETC would not be
acceptable either.

There is very little appetite for proposals of
POS at the ETC base protocol layer, though POS
sidechains or L2 solutions on top of POW are
generally well received within the ETC ecosystem.

This consensus was evident at the recent ETC Summit
2019 conference in Vancouver, Canada, and this
proposal seems to make that consensus explicit.

## Proposal

There is a broad perception that ETC has an implicit
social contract in favor of POW mining. This ECIP
seeks to transform that implicit assumption into
an explicitly written social contract, as an
ECBP which is adopted using the ECIP process.

This adoption could occur as part of the next
hard-fork (just to "batch" discussions), or it could
happen independently of that timeline. This
proposal is a formalization of an aspect of the
ETC social layer, not a technical protocol consensus
concern. Because of that, it does not need to be
synchronized with a hard fork.

## How would this be adopted?

This proposal would be adopted by means of the ECIP
editors moving it to Final state, if they are
convinced of broad ecosystem consensus in its
favor.

The Editors should use all signalling
mechanisms at their disposal to assure themselves
of broad support. That could include polls on social
media platforms, miner votes, coinvotes, public debates at meetups and events, testing the water
with "opinion pieces", repeated discussion during
the ECIP community calls, and anything else which seems prudent to them.

They should not rush this decision.

## Potential downsides of adopting this proposal?

Unlike a protocol-level consensus change,
dissent against this proposal being adopted would
not result in a chain-split - just in dissenting
voices grumbling about its adoption. That is not
problematic. The ETC ecosystem generally welcomes
dissent, and the people who would oppose this
proposal's acceptance already likely oppose
sticking with POW mining. They will be dissenters
irrespective of the result of this process.

If they choose to exit the ecosystem as a result
of this proposal being adopted then that is probably
a good thing.

## Intended benefit of adopting this proposal?

This proposal would give stakeholders in the Ethereum
Classic mining ecosystem (miners, pools, ASIC manufacturers, GPU manufacturers, etc) certainty
that any investments they make are not going to be
negated by rash future decisions by the Ethereum
Classic ecosystem to change course on the current
implicit social contract.

Making the implicit explicit, as Kirk Dameron
would often say, is a simple but immensely
powerful means for coordination.
Ambiguity is often as bad or worse than any decision,
even if that decision is not the one you would have
wanted. Like the ECIP for Monetary Policy, adoption
of this proposal will attract entities with long-term
aligned incentives to Ethereum Classic.

Bitcoin is likely the single project which has
a strong enough implicit social contract around
SHA256 that businesses can assume that it will not
be changing course - barring a situation where the
Bitcoing hashing algorithm had reached end of life,
with collisions signalling that it was time to
upgrade.

Ethereum Classic would have a uniquely strong social
signal with such an explicit statement.

## What if we "change our mind"?

If some future unforeseen event or change of
participants in the ETC ecosystem leads to broad
consensus that it is necessary for the good of the
network to break this explicit social contract then
that decision would have to go through the exact
same ECIP process as this proposal. That will
not be an easy process.

Even if it that new proposal did get approved,
the chances are that such a reversal of an
explicit social contract would be seen as so
divisive that a chain split would likely result.
This guarantee would still be respected on one of those chains (likely the majority chain).

Whatever the case, adoption of this ECIP would be
an unmistakeable sign that the Ethereum Classic
community is a very strong ally of the POW mining
ecosystem, in a way which likely on Bitcoin can
match at the moment.

## Isn't this proposal running counter to "The Manifesto"?

Some people may feel that adoption of a proposal
which seeks to make explicit social layer matters
goes against elements of the "openness"
and "neutrality" points of Arvicco's "A
Crypto-Decentralist Manifesto". This document
is broadly seen as a "Founding document" for
Ethereum Classic. There may indeed be such a perception about the manifesto, but in truth
the document is inspiration, not gospel truth,
and certainly not law.

## The need for a written Constitution and Bill of Rights for Ethereum Classic.

There is no written "Constitution" or "Bill of
Rights" for Ethereum Classic. No proposal for
such documents has ever been submitted to
the ECIP process. We have never explicitly
defined our social and ethical baseline
assumptions - only the hardness of
the protocol itself.

We depend on implicit social conformance and
watchdogs to reject proposals which breach those
baselines (ie. ProgPOW), but social conformance
to unwritten baseline assumptions is not a
safe approach.

We pride ourselves on our conservatism
and our focus on security, but we have nothing
but subjective humans standing in defence of Ethereum
Classic's unique value. We depend on particular
individuals and their "toxicity" to defend
Ethereum Classic. This approach is not socially
scalable. Those individuals may not be around
in the future. Social trends may shift.
Social attacks may grow.

This kind of loose arrangement is how British
government works. They refer to the unwritten
"Constitution" which it is expected that governments
will conform to. Essentially just precedent and
an expectation that people will "play fair".
This is an incredibly weak basis for governance.
Do we want that for Ethereum Classic?
That is what we currently have.

The author would advocate that Ethereum Classic
needs to be a Republic, not a mob Democracy, and
that we need a written Constitution and Bill of
Rights to ensure our mutual future freedom.

We need such rules to avoid the "Permissionless
Fallacy" which Donald McIntyre has explained.
There are certain proposals which would undermine
the very shared assumptions which make Ethereum
Classic "Decentralized, Unstoppable, Immutable".

The Monetary Policy ECIP was somewhat akin to
proposals which could be adopted into a
Constitution, because that policy also provided
long-term certainty for all ecosystem partipants.
The difference for the Monetary Policy is that
it was also a protocol-level consensus change,
not purely a social contract.

In actually broke immutability by changing the
future emissions schedule, but that exception
to our unwritten guiding principles was made
with broad social consensus. It had the
explicit goal of locking that economic policy
in stone forever.

## So is this proposal a Constitution?

Not really. It would just consist of a single
sentence. Something like:

"Adoption of this proposal by the ECIP authors
is an explicit social contact between the
Ethereum Classic ecosystem and the POW mining
ecosystem that ETC intends to stay with POW
mining (not merged mining) into the
indefinite future."

Such a contract could easily be adopted into
a future Constition for Ethereum Classic though.

If there is consensus that ETC needs a written
Constitution then the author will partner with
suitable co-authors and will propose one.
