Over the years, the Ethereum Classic Discord has served as a central meeting place for miners, developers, and community members around the world. It has hosted countless technical discussions, governance debates, and ecosystem announcements. However, as the platform evolved and moderation standards changed, the legacy Discord server gradually fell into an unmaintained state — with inactive administrators, broken verification flows, and recurring waves of bot spam and scam attempts.

To protect new participants and restore a professional, secure chat environment consistent with the expectations of a top-tier blockchain project, the community has established a **new Ethereum Classic Community Discord**.  

This new server was organized in December 2024 and is now being formalized as the project’s **primary public chat hub**. It features comprehensive automated moderation, anti-spam protections, and structured information channels designed to improve both safety and user experience.

### Why the Change

The previous server’s inactive administration made it difficult to implement basic protections or integrate modern tooling. Over time, this degraded the user experience and, more importantly, posed a reputational risk to new visitors encountering unchecked scam activity.

The new server resolves these issues by providing:
- **Automated moderation and verification** — spam, phishing, and impersonation are blocked automatically.  
- **Structured discussion channels** — dedicated spaces for ECIPs, mining, development, and community calls.  
- **GitHub and announcement integrations** — project updates and governance proposals appear live in-chat.  
- **Modern onboarding flow** — users can verify roles and access channels in seconds.

### Administration and Governance

The new Discord is operated by active, verifiable Ethereum Classic contributors under transparent moderation rules. Its purpose is to host open discussion about the network — including ECIPs, protocol upgrades, mining, and ecosystem development — while ensuring a safe environment for builders and new community members alike.  

Open debate remains welcome. Moderation focuses strictly on maintaining civility, preventing scams, and ensuring that discussions stay productive and on topic.

### Continuity and Legacy Access

To preserve historical context, the legacy Discord server will remain accessible with a link on the community website, but modern conversations about Ethereum Classic will be held in the maintained Discord server. Longtime community members are encouraged to migrate to the new server to continue participating in ongoing governance and ecosystem discussions.

The legacy server will remain available at [discord.com/invite/hQs894U](https://discord.com/invite/hQs894U) for archival reference and historical continuity.

This transition marks an important step toward a more professional, secure, and integrated communication experience for the Ethereum Classic ecosystem.  

As the network continues to evolve, a modernized community hub will help ensure that Ethereum Classic remains open, accessible, and resilient — the same values that have guided it since its inception.  

This update reflects Ethereum Classic’s ongoing commitment to security, transparency, and open collaboration — principles that have guided the network since its beginning.
