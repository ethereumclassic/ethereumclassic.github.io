## ETC Development Report

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! Big shout out and many thanks to all the developers, community members, user's and investors. We have a special update this week from Snaproll regarding his monetary policy proposal which was in last week's newsletter. There is also a great report just released by IOHK breaking down the Dash governance/treasury model. Thank you for taking the time to read and distribute this newsletter, looking forward to your thoughts.

* "I started doing some drafting of the ECIP for monetary policy and realized that we needed to get this thing airtight in terms of numbers, so I started reworking the spreadsheet used for analysis to enable better results......"

## Report released by IOHK breaking down Dash governance model.

IOHK has just released a report that breaks down some of the pros and cons encompassing the Dash governance/treasury system. It's a very enlightening report that definitely benefits both the Dash and ETC community. Special thanks to the Dash community for always being so open to communication and collaboration.

## "Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
