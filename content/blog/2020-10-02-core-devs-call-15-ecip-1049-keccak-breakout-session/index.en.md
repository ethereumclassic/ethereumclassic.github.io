### Recording of Core Devs Call 15

### Conclusion

* At this moment, Consensus did not appear to be present for ECIP-1049 due to many unanswered questions. 
* Recommendation from the collective call was to keep ECIP-1049 in `Last Call`, while the network analyzes the impacts of other `Accepted` proposals like [ECIP-1099](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/368) and [MESS](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/374).
* It was recommended the ECIP-1049 authors work to clarify the proposal's specs/motives to draft a more solidified version of the proposal before being considered for `Accepted` or `Rejected` status.

Please direct future commentary to the ECIP 1049 discussion thread:
