There is this thing that when something happens and it is felt as a threat to Ethereum Classic, then people go to the various social media forums, like the weekly community call or the Discord server, and say things like:

"**We** have to solve this?" 

Or

"What can **we** do to fix this?"

The first thing to understand is that there is no **"we"** in Ethereum Classic. 

This is because Ethereum Classic is decentralized and, if that is true, then there is no **"we"**. 

This is why years ago I used to argue against using terms like **"the community"** and **"we"** and things like that. 

As if ETC were some sort of club, foundation, or corporation where **"we"** exist as a legal personhood, with fiduciary duty, financial liability, and registered somewhere, so **"we"** manage things, therefore **"we"** could be sued by the US Government or **"we"** could be prohibited by the Chinese Government, and things like that.

That doesn't exist.

**"We"** just have to let governments scream to the air. Saying "ETC is prohibited" because "it's a security" or "it burns too much energy". 

It doesn't matter. 

Ethereum Classic is going to still be there. Developers are going to still be able to send smart contracts and build apps on it, and people are going to still have their money there, and nobody can do anything about it. 

Governments will migrate from the current state of denial, trying to stop the unstoppable for a while. But, then they will realize that it is futile. When this happens, when they see that Ethereum Classic is still there after all the efforts to stop it, then they will embrace it.

There's nothing **"we"** can do, **"we"** doesn't exist, and there's nothing to do other than see how the government tries to prohibit Bitcoin as well as Ethereum Classic and see how they fail.

Because it's already solved. 

**"We"** already did what **"we"** had to do which is to create a truly decentralized, *Code Is Law*, digital gold, and programmable blockchain network.

There's nothing else to do.
