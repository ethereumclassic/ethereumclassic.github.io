## ETC Core Devs Call - ECIP-1078 Phoenix Finalization

* When: Wednesday, February 05, 2020, 4pm UTC, 60 minutes max.
* Where: Ethereum Classic [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQs894U) `#ecips` channel. Will use/create a voice channel *ad hoc*.

## Agenda

### Quick client teams check-in

* Parity Tech
* ETC Core
* ChainSafe
* Multi-Geth

### Aztlán needs to be fixed, options are:

* patch ECIP-1061 with EIP-1884 [#280](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/280) - very unlikely
    * because ecip-1061 already released in parity and multi-geth
    * because ecip-1061 already activated on mordor testnet
* replace ECIP-1061 with ECIP-1079 - unlikely
    * because ECIP-1061 already released in parity and multi-geth
    * because ECIP-1061 already activated on mordor testnet
* update ECIP-1061 with ECIP-{1078,1080} - more likely
    * because ECIP-{1078,1080} can be distinct fork "Phoenix"
    * because ECIP-{1078,1080} can be activated on different testnet blocks but same mainnet block

### Phoenix (ECIP-1078) needs to be either accepted or updated (or rejected)

* discuss included ECIP-1080 without gas repricing
* discuss swap of EIP-2200 for EIP-1706 (1283 fix)
* discuss a timeline for the protocol upgrade
    * Mordor Classic and Kotti Classic testnet (March?)
    * Ethereum Classic mainnet (June?)

### Anything else related to Aztlán and Phoenix

### Going through the pending ECIP PRs together
