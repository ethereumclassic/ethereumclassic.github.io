In the above interview we speak with Istora, an Ethereum Classic volunteer and important contributor, about his project, NourishMint. 

NourishMint is an incentivized micro-contributions dapp that will help benefactors distribute donations to contributors who help causes with small, but repetitive work and actions.

We spoke about the following topics:

- What is NourishMint?
- System of contributions, registration, validation, minting, and rewards
- Participant types: Benefactors, contributors, and maintainers
- Security: How is power divided between the participant types
- Rewards: Types, weights, maturity, and trading
- Contribution types that may be rewarded in ETC: Bounties, GitHub pull requests, ECIPs, new videos, new tweets, new articles, new Twitter Spaces, Discord participation, etc.
- The web app MVP, and the backend smart contracts
