# Question

Should we make ⟠ the Ethereum Classic currency symbol?  That is Unicode code
(U+27E0).  See here: http://graphemica.com/%E2%9F%A0 .  It looks just like the
awesome green Ethereum Classic logo!  What do you think?

# ECIP

See the Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) #20 for this proposal
[here](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1020.md).
