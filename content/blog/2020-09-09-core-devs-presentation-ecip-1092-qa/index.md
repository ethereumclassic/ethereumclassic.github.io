### ECIP-1092 PirlGuard Presentation

Ethereum Commonwealth proposed a solution to 51%-attack on Ethereum Classic network: ECIP 1092. ECIP-1092 Proponents will present the ECIP and answer questions.

### Goals

Following the recommendations of representatives of other teams (mostly IOHK) and requests from community members, we decided to organize a live Q&A session. The goal of this call is to get contributors, community members, stakeholders and other teams who have created similar proposals to ask questions as needed to properly understand this proposal.

### Q&A

Questions must be submitted to this [issue comment thread](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/327) or directly at ETC Discord.
