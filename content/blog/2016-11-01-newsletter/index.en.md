## ETC Development Report.

With the recent protocol update complete, focus has now shifted towards monetary

* The bomb delay is part of the last protocol update.
* The bomb is delayed until late 2017.
* There will be another update coming in January to fix replay attack issues.
* Monetary policy proposals seem to be leaning heavily in favor of a capped supply.
* [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/108gWpOzVmsdjzWj4q8tbkpxjwVcXXLa7oFMNrAMo8x8/edit?usp=sharing) is a proposal from one of our users on Slack.
