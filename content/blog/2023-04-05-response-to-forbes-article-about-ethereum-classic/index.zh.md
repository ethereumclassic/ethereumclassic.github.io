2023年2月21日，福布斯杂志发表了一篇由贡献者[Dan Ashmore](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/dashmore/)撰写并又[Michael Adams](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/madams/)编辑的关于以太坊经典(ETC)的文章。文章题为“[What Is Ethereum Classic?（什么是以太坊经典）](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum-classic/)”.

![福布斯有关以太坊经典的文章](./etc-forbes.png)

在这篇文章中，他们试图描述区块链，提出了一系列关于它的声明，并与以太坊（ETH）进行了比较。

他们提供的一些信息是正确的，但大多数陈述都是长期以来对以太坊经典的错误再次循环。

在这篇文章中，我们将解决这些问题。

原始文章分为七个部分，每个部分包含三至五段。我们将标记我们发现问题的部分和段落以进行澄清。

我们希望福布斯能够阅读此响应，并可能对其撰写进行更正，或将此文章作为真正的回应参考。

## 部分：什么是以太坊经典？

### 此部分的第四段写道：
 
*“以太坊经典是通过对原始以太坊区块链进行分叉产生的。与许多其他区块链分叉一样，ETC是由社区内的意识形态和技术分歧而创建的。”*

### 我们的回应：

断言区块链分叉会产生一个新的链，由于分歧而与原始链分离，这是正确的，但上面的段落似乎暗示着以太坊经典是在分叉时产生的那个链。

正如福布斯接下来的部分所述，以太坊经典是原始的、未经修改的以太坊区块链。从主网分裂出来的系统是以太坊。以太坊是一个历史上发生过不规则状态变化的区块链，而ETC是于2015年7月30日上线的原始链，自起源以来一直保持不变。

## 部分：以太坊经典与DAO

### 此部分的第三和第四段写道：

*“由于黑客攻击规模的巨大，一些以太坊社区成员提议应该逆转ETH区块链以补偿被利用的用户。其他人则认为这将树立令人担忧的先例，而区块链应该天生就是不可变的。*

*进行了投票来解决争议，支持分叉方获得了超过85％的投票。ETH区块链被分叉，少数派维持了原始、未修改的以太坊区块链，并将其命名为以太坊经典。”*

### 我们的回应：

正如我们上面所写的那样，这两个段落是正确的，与前面部分所暗示的相矛盾。实际上，以太坊经典是原始的、未经修改的以太坊区块链。

## 部分：以太坊与以太坊经典

### 此部分的第一和第二段写道：

*“在基本功能方面，以太坊和以太坊经典非常相似。大多数以太坊的主要功能也存在于以太坊经典中。*

*但是ETH和ETC之间有重要的区别。最重要的是，以太坊经典与以太坊区块链的更新不兼容。”*

### 我们的回应：

这部分在很大程度上是正确的，但似乎仍暗示了一个误解。在实际使用以太坊或以太坊经典时，用户（有账户、余额和使用dapp的用户）和开发人员（在ETC上编写和部署智能合约的开发人员）几乎没有任何区别。

但在底层，维持所有参与网络的机器的共识机制确实不同，因为以太坊从工作证明迁移到了权益证明。

在核心基础设施方面，运行ETC或ETH节点或成为ETC中的矿工或矿池或成为ETH中的验证者或质押池都是不兼容的活动。

但是，以太坊经典和以太坊都遵循的EVM设计标准和格式会对用户和dapp开发人员产生影响，这方面对两者几乎是相同的。

由于区块链是开源项目，任何系统都可以采用标准中的其他系统的升级和更改。这维持了所有区块链之间的操作平衡，并意味着ETC和ETH将始终是最先进的技术，因为它们的功能和特性始终是最新的。

- 以太经典将永远是最先进的技术: https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2023-04-04-ethereum-classic-will-always-be-state-of-the-art-technology

### 本节第四段内容如下：

*“在以太坊经典社区看来，区块链和代码将永远不变。它保留了合并之前的工作量证明系统。这意味着矿工仍然需要验证 ETC 交易。”*

### 我们的回应:

以太坊经典保留了合并之前的工作量证明系统，矿工将继续为 ETC 挖矿，这一点是正确的。

然而，需要区分哪些部分是区块链的不可变部分，哪些部分是可变的。

对于像 ETC 和 ETH 这样的智能合约资产和所有权系统，保护实际账户、余额和分布式程序（即 dapp）的安全和不可变性至关重要，以确保抗审查和无需许可。这些敏感项目包含在所谓的“区块链”中，即系统的数据库。这是 ETH 通过进行 DAO 回滚所违反的，而 ETC 由于坚持真正的区块链原则而没有违反。

如果区块链网络的代码和协议本身是不可变的，那么无论是以太坊、以太经典还是比特币都不再属于区块链范畴，因为所有这些系统都不时地升级它们的系统。事实上，以太坊和以太经典在实际上步伐一致，复制了所有重要的功能，根据计数方式不同，更改了它们的协议和软件代码超过五次。

然而，在某些情况下，ETH 仅自己进行了更改，而 ETC 没有采用（例如，向权益证明的迁移），在其他情况下，ETC 进行了更改，而 ETH 没有采用（例如，停用难度炸弹）。

- 以太经典的历史: https://ethereumclassic.org/knowledge/history

### 此部分的第五段落为：

*“支持合并和反对以太坊2.0的人认为，工作量证明机制比权益证明机制更安全和去中心化。”*

### 我们的回应:

这是正确的。工作量证明机制客观上比权益证明机制更安全。这一点的证明是，当以太坊在2022年9月迁移到权益证明时，它在超过60%的区块中立即被审查。

这是因为工作量证明机制是中本聪的主要发明，由于它要求工作和电力支出，因此它保证了以下四个方面：

- 它使参与网络的所有机器之间达成共识。
- 它是自由进出系统的一个焦点。
- 它通过强制执行密码学障碍来保护交易历史记录。
- 创建货币的成本非常高，使加密货币类似于现实世界中的黄金。

以太坊采用的权益证明机制失去了所有这些保证，因为没有极其昂贵的密码学标记或哈希函数作为系统遵循的焦点。

在权益证明中，为了确定要加入哪个正确的区块链，节点必须向可信第三方检查最新状态。因此，没有所有机器在网络中遵循的焦点，而是由挖矿池决定。没有加密保护账户、余额、交易和智能合约的历史记录。而且，创造货币的成本接近于零，使得加密货币在现实世界中类似于法定货币。

## Section: Miners Move to Ethereum Classic after the Merge

### The first paragraph of this section reads:

*“After the merge, miners moved to Ethereum Classic, helping throw the smaller crypto into the limelight. The ETC hash rate, a measure of the total power being used by mining, jumped 280% in the aftermath of the merge, highlighting the extent miners have migrated to Ethereum Classic.”*

### Our response:

The above information is correct, but what deserves clarification are the related comments that continue in the next part.

### The second and third paragraphs of this section read:

*“The main driver of this spike was staking pools run by centralized companies. An Ethereum staking pool is a tool that allows multiple ETH holders to pool their tokens together to access validator status. Ethereum requires 32 ETH, roughly $44,000 at the time of this writing, to obtain a “set of validator keys.*

*Before the merge, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that helped obfuscate the origin and destination of funds on the Ethereum blockchain. The Treasury accused Tornado Cash of facilitating money laundering. This shed further light on the concern with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism.”*

### Our response:

The driver of the spike in mining in ETC has nothing to do with the Ethereum staking pools, that proof of stake is a centralized system, the validator deposit, or the Tornado Cash sanction. The driver was that when ETH migrated to proof of stake, a huge stock of mining machines in the market were orphaned and the largest compatible blockchain to mine left was Ethereum Classic. This made ETC the largest proof of work smart contracts blockchain in the world. An incredibly valuable market position.

That Ethereum is now largely centralized and that it is prone to censorship is true, but not related to the mining spike in ETC.

### The fourth paragraph of this section reads:

*“This conflict highlights the ideological divergence between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Crypto purists favor a libertarian, censorship-resistant, decentralized model, whereas crypto pragmatists point toward the more adaptable and malleable nature of Ethereum as the way to go.”*

### Our response:

Miners are a clear demonstration of the high level of permissionlessness and censorship resistance of the proof of work consensus mechanism in ETC. These network participants may move from any place in the world to any other in search of the cheapest electricity prices, they may connect and disconnect from the network whenever they wish, and they can do all these things without any real restrictions as long as they have an internet connection and a low cost source of electricity. Even in China, where cryptocurrencies and mining are prohibited, more than 20% of proof of work mining is taking place.

Proof of stake has many restrictions. For example, capital staked must remain locked for long periods of time, staking pools are largely static and identifiable entities who must comply with national constraints wherever they are located, and there are very strong economies of scale that make these players very large and entrenched, thus very vulnerable to capture.

However, this must not be seen as a mere difference of opinion. That blockchains must be immutable and extremely secure is true, and that some flexibility and “pragmatism” are ok is false. 

The whole purpose of the blockchain industry is decentralization because trusted third parties are security holes. To be a "pragmatist" because ETH is adaptable and malleable is not to be pragmatist, it is to fall for the temptation of centralism.

Migrating to technology that basically goes back to replicating the traditional fiat systems and all their flaws is an oxymoron for any blockchain system, and seeking shallow goals as “scaling” and “innovation” is to totally miss the point of the blockchain industry paradigm.

## Section: Advantages of Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic

### The first to third paragraphs of this section read:

*“Most of the Ethereum community backed the proof-of-stake conversion. Proponents cited a few big advantages.*

*First, the energy impact of the merge significantly reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99.9% from the previous proof-of-work consensus mechanism.*

*That means Ethereum Classic miners remain huge energy consumers. To put into perspective, Bitcoin mining is said to consume a quantity of electricity every year, slightly greater than Kazakhstan’s annual consumption.”*

### Our response:

There are no advantages of moving to proof of stake. The Ethereum ecosystem was deceived and Ethereum Classic made the right choice to stay with proof of work. This will be noticed with big market movements when the time comes (which are very near because of the multiple economic and geopolitical crises unfolding in the world today).

That the effects of proof of work are bad to climate change is an ongoing fallacy that would be actually very good for the planet if prestigious publications as Forbes could correct with deeper research.

These are some of the reasons that the fallacy that proof of work is bad is wrong:

1. Wind/solar are intermittent and unreliable, proof of work provides stability using electricity during surplus and switching off these sources during deficits.
2. Proof of work provides a critical mass of cash flow to renewables to be economically viable, actually accelerating the migration to green energy.
3. Proof of work is increasingly capturing methane as an energy source probably making it carbon-negative eventually.
4. The "energy per transaction" argument is a fallacy because one transaction in a blockchain may represent thousands of transactions off-chain or in layer 2 systems.
5. Proof of work is not "wasteful" from a human flourishing perspective as it provides security, hard money, and an incredible and unprecedented level of inviolable basic rights to people on a global scale.
6. Proof of work actually uses electricity that would be wasted anyway because miners are like ants eating crumbs, they don’t use the central sources of energy for humanity, but marginal discards.
7. The "if you love proof of work, then you must hate the planet" tagline is actually the opposite because of all the reasons above!

### The fourth and fifth paragraphs of this section read:

*“Ethereum Classic has disadvantages when it comes to scalability. Thanks to its less malleable code, crypto analyst are not optimistic that ETC can overcome the scalability issues, which are a big stumbling block to mass crypto adoption.*

*While scalability is also a problem for Ethereum, the community is working to improve the situation. Thanks to the much greater attention on Ethereum from developers—ETC’s resistance to change—it’s easy to see why Ethereum is so much more popular.”*

### Our response:

These two paragraphs are incorrect with regards to the idea that scalability is a problem to any blockchain, and they contradict the notion that Ethereum Classic could even have a problem if scalability or any other part of the technology stack were an issue.

First, scalability is not an issue in Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, Bitcoin or any blockchain because the blockchain industry will be layered and higher layers will command higher volumes of transactions while netting and settling them in the lower, more secure layers (which will likely be proof of work systems). This order from scalable to secure is how technology has worked for decades and the blockchain industry is no exception.

With regards to “resistance to change”, ETC has no resistance to change when it is about upgrading its technology, adding new useful features, fixing bugs, or keeping up with the EVM standard as described previously.

Therefore, the contradiction in which the Forbes argument above incurs is that if the Ethereum community is working to improve the scaling situation, thanks to the much greater attention on it from developers, whatever improvements they may create will be implemented in Ethereum Classic as well.

Again, ETH and ETC, except for the consensus layer, are practically the same technology stack. In fact, ETC core developers are active participants in the larger EVM format ecosystem, constantly working to integrate new EIPs into ETC or participating in the debates and definitions of these protocols.

## Section: Ethereum Classic Price

### The first paragraph of this section reads:

*“Ethereum has moved from strength to strength over the years, becoming the second largest crypto by market capitalization after Bitcoin.”*

### Our response:

To the contrary, Ethereum has moved from strength to weakness and Ethereum Classic has moved from weakness to strength.

Weakness in Ethereum is shown in two dimensions. The first is that it discarded proof of work as the consensus mechanism eliminating the major improvements that this technology brought to the world, namely to reach consensus with a 51% fault tolerance on a global scale, on a peer-to-peer, fully replicated network, with the highest levels of permissionlessness and censorship resistance man has ever seen.

The second one is that to build a proof of stake system, because of its inherent insecurity, developers have to create an incredibly complex protocol, with incredibly complex software clients (indeed, now to run an Ethereum proof of stake node, operators need to run two clients at the same time, not one) with ten times or more lines of code than in proof of work systems.

This complexity and volume in itself is a security hole because, by now, no one in the world may understand the whole Ethereum system and such amounts of information and moving parts only create hazards and risks where hackers and attackers may put their hands on to corrupt and tamper the system.

Ethereum Classic, just by staying with the proof of work mechanism, has advanced in the most secure and simplest way, actually improving its position in the market and its security profile because, by now, it is the largest proof of work smart contracts blockchain in the world, and the only such system that may guarantee the benefits of trust minimization and decentralization on a global scale.

### The second and third paragraphs of this section read:

*“While ETH’s current market cap is around $200 billion, forked ETC’s current market cap is a mere $3.1 billion. Yet despite being 36 times smaller than Ethereum, ETC still places in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap.*

*Ethereum Classic has largely traded like smaller cryptocurrencies, and it’s tightly correlated but more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum.”*

### Our response:

ETC will likely climb to be one of the top four blockchains in the world. This is because ETC actually does not occupy Ethereum’s position in the market. 

As a proof of stake blockchain, ETH cannot be a secure base layer system. Only proof of work networks as Bitcoin and ETC may position themselves in that segment. 

In the near future these things will become more defined in the industry and the great majority of the proof of stake blockchains will diminish while ETC will likely continue to climb in the ranks.

## Section: Should You Invest in Ethereum Classic?

### The first paragraph of this section reads:

*“Given issues concerning scalability and energy consumption, as well as the continued mainstream adoption of Ethereum, it’s difficult to imagine Ethereum Classic ever gaining a foothold like Ethereum.”*

### Our response:

As previously described in our responses above, scalability is not an issue in the blockchain industry and energy consumption is a fallacy because proof of work actually helps the planet by accelerating the migration to renewable energy.

ETH and ETC will actually not compete in them market. Ethereum will have a certain position in the market as a layer 2 scalable system and Ethereum Classic will have a different position as a base layer, highly secure blockchain. Both will be very valuable, but arguably, Ethereum Classic more valuable than Ethereum due to its true security guarantees.

### The second paragraph of this section reads:

*“ETH is working to improve its drawbacks, while Ethereum Classic is staying largely the same.”*

### Our response:

Again, Ethereum is making its drawbacks worse by constantly adding patches and fixes to its stack that increase complexity which is a major source of risk and attack vectors. On top of this, it is driving its system to centralization which is exactly opposite of what a blockchain should do.

As explained before, Ethereum Classic is not staying largely the same. It is actually on par with Ethereum technologically and will always be state of the art technology.

In fact, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum will both ossify in the near future, precisely because adding components, introducing fixes, and complex design to make them work is actually a huge danger to these systems.

When ETC is regarded as an “immutable” system it is because of its guarantees with regards to accounts, balances, and dapps. This is its true and distinguishing value, and is only possible with the real decentralization that proof of work provides.

**For more information:**

### The third paragraph of this section reads:

*“The virtues of altering the code can be debated, but no matter how virtuous or immutable Ethereum Classic is, if it is not practical enough to be used on a global stage, it won’t ever gain the kind of traction that more suitable cryptocurrencies will.”*

### Our response:

Given that Ethereum Classic’s security guarantees are its virtues, and this includes immutability, which is one of the most important or the most important feature that the blockchain industry has provided to the world, and that ETC is entirely practical because it is perfectly usable with virtually unlimited scalability through layer 2 systems, and that its technology stack will always be state of the art because it is part of the EVM standard, then the above statement is incorrect, and ETC is perfectly positioned to reap the rewards of its design choices and will increasingly gain traction, as it has been the case for a long time, to become one of the largest blockchains in the world.

### The fourth paragraph of this section reads:

*“Unless ETC solves more of its problems or there is an unforeseen negative development with Ethereum, the prospects for Ethereum Classic taking over the big stage is remote at best.”*

### Our response:

For all the reasons we have given in this response, we can’t disagree more with this final statement.
