It is a pleasure to announce that the EthereumClassic.org website is now available in 22 Languages.

Today, in addition to the previously enabled English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Russian, another 16 locales have been enabled. In total, the following languages are now available:

- English
- 中文 (Chinese)
- اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ (Arabic)
- Deutsch (German)
- Español (Spanish)
- Ελληνικά (Greek)
- Français (French)
- עִבְרִית (Hebrew)
- हिन्दी (Hindi)
- Hrvatski (Croatian)
- Italiano (Italian)
- 日本語 (Japanese)
- 한국어 (Korean)
- Malay
- Nederlands (Dutch)
- Português (Portuguese)
- русский (Russian)
- ภาษาไทย (Thai)
- Türk (Turkish)
- Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)
- 粵語 (Cantonese)

The main content on this website has been automatically machine-translated into these languages and can be viewed by using the globe icon at the top right of each page. 

Historical blog posts and user-submitted content such as apps are not translated, but can be. Videos and news links available in specific languages are also able to be listed.

As these translations were not created manually, there may be grammatical and contextual errors throughout, but now that the internationalization (i18n) system and contribution workflow is live, we encourage community members to help us improve this content.

Translations are managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com), a popular service for collaborating on localization, which should make the contribution process as seamless as possible. Crowdin has graciously granted the Ethereum Classic project an open source license, which allows us to use their service for without payment.
