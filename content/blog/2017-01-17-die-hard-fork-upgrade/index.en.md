## **ETC Development Report**

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! This is the second newsletter of 2017 and ETC is off to a fantastic start. On Friday January 13th at block 3,000,000 the ETC community moved forward into the future with the protocol upgrade/hardfork dubbed "DieHard". The "DieHard" upgrade included the following protocol improvements:

* Difficulty Bomb delay (ECIP-1010)
* EXP reprice (EIP-160)
* Replay Protection (EIP-155)

I can't thank the ETC development community enough for all the hard work and countless hours they put in to make sure ETC is the most stable, secure platform that it can possibly be. I'd also like to thank the miners, exchanges, investors, traders and other community members for committing themselves to some of the best teamwork I have ever seen. The ETC community consists of countless countries, languages, cultures and ideas but the communication and teamwork managed to transcend all of those obstacles. This teamwork has helped thrust the ETC project into a stronger position than I could have ever imagined 6 months ago. An article by Aaron Van Wirdum covering the successful update was featured in [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-classic-hard-forks-diffuses-difficulty-bomb-1484350622/) as well as [nasdaq.com.](http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ethereum-classic-hard-forks-diffuses-difficulty-bomb-cm733563)

## **ETC Monetary Policy**

ETC Monetary Policy Proposal by @snaproll is now officially out as ECIP-1017

"This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model." Please see the full post from github and reddit at the links below.

Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on the #monetary_policy channel on slack.

## **Ethereum Classic is looking for Rust & JS developers.**

Igor aka Splix is looking for talented Rust and JS developers. Full time, remote. Experienced developers, which can lead projects, make architectural decisions and help other team members to do their job. Self motivated and able to work in a distributed team on Open Source software together with the community.

## **"Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.**
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
