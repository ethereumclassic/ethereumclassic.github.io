[Proof of
work](https://steemit.com/etc/@cseberino/let-s-admit-blockchains-are-weird-an-introduction-to-the-strangeness)
systems are widely used and have been thoroughly scrutinized. There is concern
that funds will be at risk if proof of work systems are replaced with proof of
stake systems. Fortunately, proof of stake systems can *improve* security rather
than *threatening* it!

## Proof Of Stake

![](./0mf8PsX4EY9YMwj61.jpg)

In proof of work systems, volunteers assist in the creation and validation of
new
[blocks](https://medium.com/@cseberino/ethereum-classic-blocks-explained-the-three-categories-33b20785013c).
Rewards are proportional to the amount of *computing resources* contributed to
the process. There are built in disincentives for acting maliciously or
foolishly. For example, contributing computing resources to losing chains will
lead to financial losses.

Proof of stake systems attempt to keep the benefits of proof of work systems
while eliminating the problems. There are multiple varieties and much [ongoing
research](http://eprint.iacr.org/2017/232.pdf). Volunteers still assist in the
creation and validation of new blocks. Rewards are proportional to the amount of
*funds* (stakes) temporarily placed in escrow. There are still built in
disincentives for acting maliciously or foolishly. For example, some systems
confiscate escrowed funds if volunteers simultaneously work on multiple chains.

### Benefits

Proof of stake systems can *strengthen* proof of work systems rather than
replacing them. They can simply *add* additional steps to the process of
approving candidate blocks. This is analogous to adding a second lock on a door.
Additional protections are welcome because proof of work systems are vulnerable
to participants who control a majority of the computing resources. This can lead
to *51% attacks*:

> "[A] mining pool — an association of people who own specialized hardware that
> produces Bitcoins by running specific mathematical operations — gained a 51
percent share of computing power used in currency production. That gave it the
power to reverse transactions, to pay twice with the same Bitcoins, and to delay
or even cancel other people’s transactions. The pool was GHash.io, run by a
secretive U.K.-incorporated outfit called CEX.io"

and

> "I am Chandler Guo, a 51% attack on Ethereum Classic (ETC) is coming with my
> 98G hashrate. This is roughly 3 times [the] current ETC network hashrate. This
is an action to against Poloniex’s decision to support ETC."

> [Cointelegraph, July 24,
> 2016](https://cointelegraph.com/news/realm-of-ethereum-splits-into-two-coins-volume-hashrate-of-etc-surges)

Such attacks might not be possible with proof of stake system additions.

### Concerns

It is possible that vulnerabilities might be found in proof of stake systems.
Although combining proof of work and proof of stake systems would likely be
beneficial, there might still be problems. This is analogous to losing the key
to a second door lock. Multiple door locks provide additional security, but,
they also increase the chances of denying yourself access.

## Conclusion

Proof of stake systems do not necessarily have to eliminate proof of work
systems. Blockchain systems can simultaneously juggle security *and* innovation.
