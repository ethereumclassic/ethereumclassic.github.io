One of the largest crypto-currency exchanges in China, [CHBTC](http://www.chbtc.com/), has [announced a series of donations](http://www.chbtc.com/news/show-1374-proclamation) to the Ethereum Classic (ETC) project. The donations will provide support to current and future development efforts, as well as kickstart various community building proposals. Today’s announcement by CHBTC, follows through on [discussions that took place early August](http://www.chbtc.com/news/show-1370-proclamation).

Funds contributed by CHBTC to ETC core development will be applied to accelerate the introduction of solutions to the so-called “difficulty bomb”. These solutions are important to ensure long-term viability of PoW mining on Ethereum Classic blockchain.

Another initiative that received CHBTC funding is focused on ETC community building in China. It will support localisation of ETC materials and development of the official Chinese ETC website located at ethereumclassic.cn, as well as community websites and news portals. A portion of the donation will also fund organizing ETC meetups and other community events in different cities around the country.

The Ethereum Classic community would like to express deep gratitude to CHBTC for this important contribution to ETC’s development. It will serve to strengthen the Ethereum Classic technical community as well as ETC’s position in China and worldwide.
