Many initiatives are raising capital with initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The Ethereum (ETH) project raised 18 million dollars and the DAO project raised 150 million dollars!  Furthermore, the entire blockchain space is worth 90 *billion* dollars!  I will describe ICOs and their custom cryptocurrencies on Ethereum Classic (ETC).

## ICO Basics

![ICO](./094886790b.png)

An ICO is a method of raising funds with the sale of a new cryptocurrency.  These cryptocurrencies are often required to purchase goods and services from the issuing organizations.  For example, the ETH cryptocurrency (ether) is used to rent ETH system resources.  Upcoming ICOs are typically announced on [Bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0) forums and heavily marketed beforehand.  Buyers often purchase the new cryptocurrencies by sending bitcoins or ether to escrow accounts.  The initial prices are set, then supply and demand determines the future prices.  If the organizations are well managed, and their cryptocurrencies prove useful, they should both increase in value.  If prices skyrocket, minuscule cryptocurrency subdivisions can typically be used.  For example, ETC cryptocurrency tokens can be subdivided into as many as 10<sup>18</sup> pieces.

Caution is required with ICOs as they are effectively *unregulated*.  Participants do not purchase ownership in companies, nor, many privileges protected by established case law.  There is great potential for innovation as well as scams.  [Smith & Crown]( https://www.smithandcrown.com) and [ICOrating](http://icorating.com/) are two resources that can assist with ICO research.

## ICO Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are implemented with [smart contracts](https://steemit.com/etc/@cseberino/the-skinny-on-smart-contracts-an-introduction-and-why-you-should-care). ETC provides an excellent smart contract platform.  It has all of the functionality of ETH at a fraction of the cost.

Many exchanges and other users prefer crytocurrencies to adhere to the [Ethereum Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20).  This standard specifies the following interfaces for cryptocurrency smart contracts:

| INTERFACE                                            | DESCRIPTION                       |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| transfer(receiving_address, transfer_amount)         | Transfers funds between accounts. |
| balanceOf(account_address)                           | Returns account balances.      |
| totalSupply()                                        | Returns the total supply.         |

The standard also specifies the following interfaces for when a user wants *another* account to also manage their funds:

| INTERFACE	                                                        | DESCRIPTION                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| approve(approved_address, approved_amount)                       	| Allows other accounts to also transfer funds. |
| transferFrom(sending_address, receiving_address, transfer_amount)	| Transfers funds between accounts.         |
| allowance(shared_address, approved_address) 	                     | Returns approved amounts.    |

It is also common to include the following named constants:

| NAMED CONSTANT | DESCRIPTION                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| name           | cryptocurrency name                                         |
| symbol         | cryptocurrency exchange ticker symbol                                |
| decimals       | cryptocurrency maximum number of subdivision decimal places |

For example, the ETC cryptocurrency exchange ticker symbol is ETC.  Since ETC cryptocurrency tokens can be divided into as many as 10<sup>18</sup> pieces, the maximum number of subdivision decimal places is 18.

### Sample Code

There are many [Ethereum Token Standard compliant Solidity smart contract examples](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) available.  Here is an example of an Ethereum Token Standard compliant [Serpent](https://steemit.com/etc/@cseberino/serpent-introduction-to-the-best-ethereum-classic-smart-contract-language) smart contract:

## Conclusion

![money](./09489072fd.jpg)

ICOs are a new way to raise funds and the ETC platform is an excellent choice for the required cryptocurrency smart contracts.  Vigilance due to the lack of regulations remains important. Hopefully, mechanisms to protect against abuse will allow an ever growing number of people to reap the benefits.
