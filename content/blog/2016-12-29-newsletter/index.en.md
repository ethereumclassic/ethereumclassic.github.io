## **ETC Development Report**

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! This will be the last newsletter of the year and it's incredible thinking about how much the community has progressed since the beginning. I want to send out one last **giant** end of the year thank you to all the developers, miners, community members, user's and investors. It has definitely been a real roller coaster ride but the entire community has done such an excellent job working together, I couldn't be happier.

A lot was going on last week, so this newsletter is packed. Security is of the utmost importance, so the lead off story is in reference to some users having trouble finding peers with Geth after a fresh install, please see the link/instructions for more info. Also featured is the ["DieHard"](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v3.2.3) protocol upgrade coming in January 15 at block 3,000,000. Thank you to everyone that contributed to "DieHard", nothing would be possible without all the hard work ETC devs put in. The protocol upgrade includes:

* Difficulty Bomb delay (ECIP-1010)
* EXP reprice (EIP-160)
* Replay Protection (EIP-155)

## **Trouble finding peers with Geth?**
Several ETC geth users reported problems connecting to peers after a fresh install. If your full node has trouble finding peers, you may want to try adding static peer file manually. An up-to-date list of ETC peers maintained by Epool can be found here:

* http://www1.epool.io/enodes.txt

This list of nodes should be added to ".ethereum/static-nodes.json".

## **Update ETC Geth 3.2.3 aka "DieHard".** 

Diehard protocol upgrade coming in January 15 at block 3,000,000 is ready for release. DieHard protocol upgrade includes:

* Replay Protection (EIP-155)
* Github:https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v3.2.3

## **Let's talk ETC! Tuesdays at 7:30pm EST.**

Every Tuesday at 7:30pm EST we will be discussing what's going on in the ETC community and beyond. Last weeks show (12-20-16) features special guest Matt M aka "Snaproll" who is the creator of the monetary policy proposal featured in this newsletter. We will discuss monetary policy, ETC and blockchain in general. A link to the channel/show will be posted below, if you have ideas or questions please let us know. Thank you for subscribing to our latest updates and announcements!

## **ETC Monetary Policy** 

ETC Monetary Policy Proposal by @snaproll is now officially out as ECIP-1017

"This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model." Please see the full post from github and reddit at the links below.

Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on the #monetary_policy channel on slack.

## **"Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.** 
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
