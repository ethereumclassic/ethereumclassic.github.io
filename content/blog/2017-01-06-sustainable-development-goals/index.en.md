## Inherent Sustainability

One of the core values of Ethereum Classic has always been sustainaility due to several reasons specially as a perpetuation strategy for not only ETC community but the human species itself.
We now have new opportunities ahead to broaden ETC presence in the blockchain space by collaborating to include wider measures of value and thus becoming instrumental in achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development goals.

## World has changed

Recently the [COP21](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cop21/) conference raised diplomatic bars and was regarded as a [monumental triumph](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/12/un-chief-hails-new-climate-change-agreement-as-monumental-triumph/#prettyPhoto) and a [victory for the planet](http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/universal-cop21-agreement-a-victory-for-the-planet).

> It sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all.

> [Ban Ki-moon](http://www.un.org/sg/) in a tweet, immediately following its adoption.


195 countries are signators of the COP21 conference and they are naturally pushed to deliver sustainable results over the next decades because of their already signed commitment.
In other words there's increased interest and funding available to initiatives able to bring closer to reality the UN target for a more sustainable world at 2030.

### Fintech Development Lab
Tomorrow, operating through the UN Innovation Centre, the [Blockchain Alliance for Good](http://www.bisgit.org/) launches its Fintech development lab to deliver the United Nations **S**ustainable, **D**evelopment **G**oals.
In a nutshell, the effort brings social innovation through the power of the blockchain to truly engage and empower communities to achieve structural and sustainable change.

### Centre for Citizenship Enterprise and Governance Support
