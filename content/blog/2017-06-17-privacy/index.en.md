Privacy is the power to control the communication of personal information.
Recent news may discourage some people involved with Ethereum Classic (ETC) from
protecting privacy. Here are the basics of privacy including why it is
*indispensable*:

# Universal & Traditional

The Constitution does not explicitly mention a right to privacy. However,
according to the Supreme Court, it contains an *implicit* right to privacy.
Justice William O. Douglas, in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), wrote that
privacy is “within the penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights”.
Furthermore, 150 countries have constitutions granting *explicit* privacy
rights. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights also explicitly mentions
a right to privacy:

> *“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family,
> home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone
has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or
attacks.”*

A right to privacy is not a new and radical idea. Rather, it is a universal and
traditional one. The Ethereum Classic community is just promoting the principles
of the United States, 150 other countries, and, the United Nations!

# Beneficial & Necessary

Privacy is beneficial partly because *everyone* wants to hide something that is
*appropriate* to be kept secret! For example, some may: be working through
embarrassing medical or psychological issues, be on their honeymoon, be
awkwardly exploring new artistic endeavors, or, just be going to the bathroom.
The actions of people that say privacy is not important reveal their true
sentiments. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook [purchased the
houses](http://time.com/money/4346766/mark-zuckerberg-houses/) surrounding his
California home to ensure a haven of privacy. Eric Schmidt of Google [punished
CNET](http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/05/technology/google_cnet/) for publishing
some of his personal details. Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian reporter who
assisted Edward Snowden, challenges anyone that thinks privacy is not important
make all their emails public. Nobody has yet met his challenge!

Privacy is also beneficial because *no* government is completely free from
corruption. Global surveillance, confiscation of funds and censorship are just a
few examples of documented governmental abuse. Imagine if you had never heard of
Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi and Julian Assange because
dissent was not possible.

Some believe privacy must be sacrificed for security. However, it is possible to
have security and privacy. They are not mutually exclusive. An apartment complex
could implement an identification card system thereby providing security at the
expense of privacy. Alternatively, door locks and alarm systems could provide
the same or better security while maintaining privacy!

# Conclusion

A right to privacy is an old, traditional, beneficial and necessary idea. The
Ethereum Classic community is doing a public service in promoting it.
