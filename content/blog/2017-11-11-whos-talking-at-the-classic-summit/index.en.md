First, a disclaimer, despite what you may think I have no inside information,
and honestly prefer the lack of hype to major hype. Major hype is unstable. So
get excited, but don’t get hyped.

## [Digital Currency Group (DCG)](http://dcg.co/)

Created the [Ethereum Classic Investment
Trust](https://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-investment-trust/) which brought
additional investment into Classic. They also created the [ETC
Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/) which is funding [the summit](https://etcsummit.com/) and
seeking to fund other projects that improve the Classic ecosystem.

DCG will be represented by Barry Silbert (CEO), Meltem Demirrors (Director), and
Matthew Beck (Research Associate).

## [ETCDEV](https://www.etcdevteam.com/)

Has given us [geth for ETC](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum)
(after EF refused to support us), [Emerald
Wallet](https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet), two
[blockchain](http://gastracker.io/)
[explorers](https://github.com/ethereumproject/explorer), new [dev
tools](https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm), and lots more. They’ve got
a whole [roadmap](https://www.etcdevteam.com/roadmap.html) you can check out.

Four members of ETCDEV will be attending, [Igor
Artamonov](https://github.com/splix) (CTO), [Constantine
Kryvomaz](https://github.com/r8d8) (Rust Developer), and [Isaac
Ardis](https://github.com/whilei) (Go Developer), and Matt Mazur (Advisor) who
will be talking about the [ETC Monetary
Policy](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md).

## [Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK)](https://iohk.io/)

Is developing a new ETC node called Mantis, [formalized the EVM in
K](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) (fancy maths; great for
Classic), gave us Let’s Talk ETC, and is [tying ETC
in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6scO_RMEgQ&feature=youtu.be) with their
Cardano platform.

IOHK is sending four employees, Charles Hoskinson (CEO), Christian Seberino
(Education), Alan McSherry (ETC Developer), and Alan Verbner (ETC Developer). A
couple of them have been on Let’s Talk ETC as well: [Charles on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4YjI6oYVY&index=7&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5)
and [Alan on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsUFzKoIW3I&index=8&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5).

## [Cody Burns](https://github.com/realcodywburns)

He’s worked on [Classic Ether
Wallet](http://classicetherwallet.com), proposed how we can
have [private addresses on
ETC](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/78), and wants to give us
[cross-chain atomic
swaps](https://medium.com/@DontPanicBurns/ethereum-cross-chain-atomic-swaps-5a91adca4f43).

## [Stewart Mackenzie](https://github.com/sjmackenzie)

Founded [Fractalide](http://fractalide.com/), a marketplace designed to make ETC
contracts easier to develop. [Stewart on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-IL6-aXko&index=19&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5).

## [Jihan Wu](https://twitter.com/jihanwu?lang=en)

He runs [Bitmain](http://bitmain.com/) and [Antpool](http://antpool.com/), the
largest Bitcoin mining pool.

*****

Anyway this is only about half of the attendees, there’s lots more miners,
exchange operators, developers attending and contributing to Classic. So again,
get excited, but don’t get hyped!
