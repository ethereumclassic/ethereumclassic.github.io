## ETC Core Devs Presentation - ECBP-1100 Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring Presentation and Q&A

* When: Wednesday, September 23, 2020. 14:00 UTC; 30 minute presentation followed by Q&A
* Where: Crowdcast (Link TBA)

Please follow the meeting discussion here as they finalize the variables in real-time:

### ECBP-1100 Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring Presentation

ETC Labs Core, in consultancy with OpenRelay and ChainSafe, develop and propose a finality algorithm called MESS for Ethereum Classic that, if adopted by the honest majority, would raise chain state finality near-exponentially with negligible risk of network bifurcation.

* Overview "Artificial Finality" and non-invasive 51-percent-protection
* Quick explanation of the "MESS" protocol (ECIP-1100)
* LIVE Demo on the MESS testnet using Geth
* Community Q&A session

### Motivation
A low hashrate has caused Ethereum Classic's consensus algorithms to yield inconvenient and undesirable finality rates. ECIP-1100 "MESS" offers a way to increase the finality rate without tampering with existing "hard" chain consensus functions or characteristics, and to do so with minimal negative side effects.

### Q&A

Questions must be submitted to this [issue comment thread](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/374) or directly at ETC Discord.
