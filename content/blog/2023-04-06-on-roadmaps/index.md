Constructive criticism is essential for any project, and it's crucial to address concerns raised by the community. The recent [Lesson from the Oak Tree](/blog/2023-04-01-lessons-from-the-oak-tree) blog post sparked a response on Twitter, which highlighted a frequent critique of ETC – it's lack of a roadmap.

> ETC is NOT growing like an oak tree and you know that. And if it does then it’s too slow. ETC doesn’t even have a roadmap that you should have written an article about [it. ...]

In this post, we will address this common criticism of Ethereum Classic not having a traditional roadmap, and explore the alternative decentralized approach that ETC takes towards its development.

## Slow and Steady

The point of the Oak Tree article was that ETC's growth is intentionally slow and steady, trading off explosive growth for long term success. The "Move Fast and Break Things" mentality is not suitable for cryptocurrencies that wish to survive long term, as it adds unnecessary risk in an already risky environment. 

The ETC website's [Future](/knowledge/future) section explains the project's approach to future development, including a [Move Slowly and Don't Break Things](/knowledge/future#move-slowly-dont-break-things) subsection. To summarize briefly:

- ETC's approach to development is distinct from a typical company or crypto project due to its decentralized nature.
- The project's development strategy emphasizes a meritocratic, organic process rather than a top-down, centralized roadmap.
- ETC follows the Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) process for discussing and vetting potential upgrades.
- The project aims for a gradual process of ossification, similar to Ethereum's long-term goal.

## Decentralized Projects Can't Have Roadmaps

Traditional roadmaps, rooted in corporate and centralized approaches to project development, are ill-suited to decentralized projects like Ethereum Classic. The very nature of ETC's social organization sets it apart from typical companies or crypto projects, making the imposition of a roadmap incongruous with its core principles.

For a roadmap to be possible, a central organizing committee would be necessary, inevitably introducing the centralization risk that Ethereum Classic strives to avoid. This risk is elaborated upon in the [Decentralism](/why-classic/decentralism) section. As such, it becomes clear that the conventional roadmap model is incompatible with the vision and values of a truly decentralized project like Ethereum Classic.

Instead, ETC has a "Decentralized Roadmap", which is continuously open to debate, question, and inevitably changing over time. By rejecting the idea of having a conventional roadmap, the project simply embraces the truth that having a fixed plan is incompatible with this decentralized context.

## Evolutionary Pathways

In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, predicting the future is a difficult task. Traditional roadmaps often fail meet their goals or adapt to the rapid changes in the landscape and become outdated or inaccurate. Acknowledging this reality, it's not only principal-compatible, but more pragmatic to focus on a general sense of direction rather than pretending to know the destination.

This is where the concept of a "pathway" comes into play, capturing the spirit of Ethereum Classic's decentralized, emergent development approach. Unlike top-down decision-making imposed by centralized roadmaps, an evolutionary pathway allows for innovative ideas to emerge organically from anywhere within the community and be implemented if they gain consensus. 

This flexibility was exemplified by the [Thanos fork](/blog/2020-11-27-thanos-hard-fork-upgrade/), which successfully reduced the size of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by taking advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity that increased the security and value of ETC. Such opportunistic pivots are less likely to be implemented if they deviate from a strict top-down development plan.

## Navigating Unknown Territory

Navigating the future of the cryptocurrency space is much like venturing through unknown territory, such as a dense jungle. In these uncertain landscapes, traditional roadmaps can be unreliable and may lead us astray. Instead, it's essential to adopt a more flexible and adaptive approach: the pathway.

While a roadmap attempts to dictate a rigid route with predetermined milestones, a pathway focuses on following core principles and values that guide the project's development. Like a skilled explorer in the jungle, we must remain open to adapting our path, trailblazing new directions when necessary, and embracing opportunities that arise along the way.

By prioritizing our principles over a fixed destination, we ensure that Ethereum Classic remains true to its values and vision, even as the landscape around us shifts and changes. Emphasizing flexibility, adaptability, and community-driven innovation, the pathway approach allows us to traverse the unknown terrain with confidence. Trusting in our ability to forge a pathway that honors the spirit of our project, we can successfully navigate a dynamic and competitive environment while staying true to ETC's decentralized principles.

## The ECIP Machete

The [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/) (ECIP) process, which can be considered as the machete guiding our journey through the jungle, is a key component of Ethereum Classic's (ETC) approach. Inspired by Bitcoin's (BTC) Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, the ECIP process enables ETC to make decentralized decisions while emphasizing adaptability and community-driven innovation.

Both ETC and BTC share a commitment to decentralized social organization without a central committee, consensus-driven development, and prioritizing core principles. By embracing a flexible, community-oriented approach, ETC is well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin, ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.

The intricacies of how decisions are actually implemented within both ETC and BTC are a deep topic that warrants [further exploration](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/19/ethereum-classic-ungovernance-explained/10522/). Stay tuned for an upcoming blog post that delves into the decentralized, meritocratic, and emergent processes at the heart of these cryptocurrency ecosystems.

## Real-World Advantages

When evaluating the merits of traditional roadmaps versus the more decentralized pathways, several factors come into play. Stacking up the pros and cons of each approach, it becomes apparent that not only is the pathway approach necessary for decentralization, but more is advantageous when compared to having a fixed roadmap in the context of cryptocurrencies.

- **Greater flexibility and adaptability:** With no rigid milestones, pathways allow projects to pivot and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the crypto world, ensuring they remain relevant and responsive to emerging trends and technologies.
- **Community-driven decision-making:** Emphasizing the collective wisdom of the community, pathways enable the best ideas to emerge organically and gain consensus, ensuring that development is genuinely representative of the project's stakeholders.
- **Learning from other projects' experiences:** pathways allow projects to observe and analyze the successes and failures of other initiatives, incorporating valuable lessons into their own development processes without having to take on the associated risks.
- **Reduced risk of centralization and resilience to social attacks:** pathways foster a community-driven decision-making process that prevents the undue influence of a central authority, preserving the project's core values and principles. Additionally, the decentralized nature of pathways makes projects less vulnerable to social engineering, collusion, or other manipulative tactics that could undermine their integrity.

## Perceived Disadvantages

It's prudent to consider the perceived negatives that the absence of a traditional roadmap may create, which may include:

- **Uncertainty for stakeholders:** The lack of a clear roadmap can create uncertainty and confusion for users and developers, making it challenging to plan for the project's future or gauge its progress.
- **Unfamiliar process to outsiders:** Those accustomed to traditional roadmaps may find the Pathway approach unfamiliar and difficult to grasp, potentially hindering the project's ability to attract new talent or gain support from the wider community.
- **Slower pace of innovation:** With a more cautious and deliberative development process, Pathways may result in a slower rate of innovation compared to projects with aggressive roadmaps and ambitious timelines.

The issue of perception is difficult to address directly, but in all of these cases, as time goes on, education and the [hard wood truth](/blog/2023-04-01-lessons-from-the-oak-tree#hard-wood-truths) of ETC's persistence will demonstrate that these perceived disadvantages are unwarranted. Looking back, it will be clear they all stem from the misapplication of traditional thinking to the necessary trade-offs that safeguard the longevity of decentralized cryptocurrency projects.

## Towards Ossification

What happens when Ethereum reaches the end of it's current roadmap? In a recent interview, in a section titled "[Ethereum Roadmap](https://youtu.be/1xhPqZZYJSE?t=2753)", Vitalik hinted Etehreum will be "done" at the end of 2023, at 

One  to address these concerns is to point to alternative projects "end goal" of roadmaps.

- Even Ethereum hopes to ossify, and so should good crypto projects.

Ossification can be seen as reaching maturity in the lifecycle of a tree, where it is strong a sturdy and continues to persist, largely unchanged, for many decades to come.

For either project, does a lack of roadmap at this stage signal failure? Far from it, ossification enables continued predictable operation and therefore facilitiates innovation happening in the ecosystem around the project.

## Potential Paths for the Future

There are some clear wins on the horizon for ETC.

- Adopting the Erigon Client
- EVM Upgradability (as discussed in future section)
- Add cryptographic primatives similar to ETH mainnet to support L2 and privacy
- L2 Scalability
- inherit the Selecting the Migration of projects from ETH, the cream of the crop 
- Funding of new projects via the ETCGrantsDAO

These may not be exciting or flashy, but they needn't be.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Ethereum Classic's unique approach to development might not fit the traditional concept of a roadmap, but it offers a more decentralized, adaptable, and sustainable path for the project's future. By following the ECIP process and embracing a slower, more cautious development approach, ETC ensures that it remains a robust and reliable platform for years to come.
