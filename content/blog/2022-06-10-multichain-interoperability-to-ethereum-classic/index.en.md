This integration adds a reputable interoperability solution for the Ethereum Classic network with access to $5+ Billion in bridged asset liquidity through 50+ networks. This integration enables projects from other networks to natively support and migrate to Ethereum Classic, the original Ethereum network launched in 2015.
