As we showed in our previous post about DappNode, our core developer Chris Ziogas has integrated the ETC Core Geth software client to the DappNode dappstore for the ETC mainnet and the Mordor testnet. In this post we will show four videos with the unboxing of a new DappNode device, then connecting it to the power feed and to your local router at home or office, connecting it to your computer so you can manage your nodes on the device, and finally installing the ETC Core Geth client both for the mainnet and the testnet.

## 1. DappNode Unboxing

In this first segment we unbox the DappNode, we show what a beautiful device it is so it can fit esthetically to any environment, and the different parts that come with it.

## 2. Connecting Your DappNode to Your Home or Office Router

Here we show how to connect to the wall, to the local WiFi router, and set it up in your media area or where the routers and cable connections are in your home or office.

## 3. Connecting Your Computer (Mac or Windows) to Your DappNode

In this segment we show how to associate your newly installed DappNode to your computer, whether it is a Mac or Windows, and how to start managing your DappNode, changing passwords, and going over each section of the user interface.

## 4. Installing the ETC Core Geth Mainnet and Testnet Node Clients

Now that everything is set, we show in this last video how to install the ETC Core Geth clients for the mainnet and testnet.
