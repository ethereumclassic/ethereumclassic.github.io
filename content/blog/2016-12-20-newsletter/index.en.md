## ETC Development Report

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! Big shout out and many thanks to all the developers, miners, community members, user's and investors. The monetary policy meetup in London last week was really special so I'm going to leave it in this week's newsletter in case anyone missed it. Special thanks again to our panelists, Splix, Snaproll, Avtar and [Eversheds LLP](http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/index.page) who hosted the event. I'm happy to let everyone know that it was professionally recorded so footage of the event will be released soon. I leaving in the introduction of the new IOHK dev team dubbed ["The Grothendieck Team"](https://iohk.io/projects/ethereum-classic/#team) as well as the monetary policy update from previous newsletters since it's still the focus of many discussions throughout the community.  Be sure to check out ETC newspaper updated daily ["ETC.today"](http://etc.today/), it's a pleasure to read and I really recommend it. We also have an [instructional video series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbE_HTAVD08mMQ5jBBUgKGw) on mining that our friends over at [Epool](http://epool.io/#/) just started. Additionally, there is another [article](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-12-16-parity/) from Dr. Seberino about setting up an ETC node as well as an [article](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereum-austrian-kin/) from cryptocoinsnews.com. Thank you for taking the time to read and distribute this newsletter, looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

## ETC monetary policy meetup was excellent!
The event organized by Dr. Avtar Sehra  London which took place last week on Tuesday, December 13th, 2016 was excellent. It was hosted by one of the leading financial services law firms, [Eversheds LLP](http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/index.page), at their London St. Pauls Head Quarters. The focus of the event was to provide an update on the activity in the ETC community so far and what the future holds in terms of projected roadmap. The topics covered during the presentation included:

* An update on what has happened so far in the ETC Ecosystem. 
* A presentation by ETC dev "Splix".
* A presentation by "Snaproll", author of the monetary policy proposal ECIP-1017 
* Planned monetary policy hard fork and why it matters.
* [Panel discussion](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-12-04-monetary-policy-event/) on monetary policy, economics and the future of cryptocurrency.

The event was professionally recorded so expect some great media of the event coming out soon.

## The Grothendieck Team
In case you missed it, last week we officially announce the new team known as The Grothendieck Team! The team has been named after Alexander Grothendieck, a German-born French mathematician who became a leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. They have been committed to Ethereum Classic by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) in order to build a Scala client for ETC based on IOHK’s [Scorex framework](https://iohk.io/projects/scorex/). Plans are in place to bring the team on [“Let’s Talk ETC!”](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCojbn_iTgg4BxcSphz0MGMg) to discuss the roadmap and development timeframe for ETC in 2017 (after they have properly reviewed the ETC documentation). Links to the IOHK website, Scorex page, Let’s Talk ETC! youtube channel and ETC blog are posted below.

## ETC Monetary Policy 

ETC Monetary Policy Proposal by @snaproll is now officially out as ECIP-1017
"This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its currentEthash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model."

Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on the #monetary_policy channel on slack.

## "Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
