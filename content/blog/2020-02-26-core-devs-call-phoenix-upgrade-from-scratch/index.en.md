## ETC Core Devs Call - Phoenix Upgrade from Scratch

* When: Wednesday, February 26, 2019, 1pm UTC, 60 minutes max.
* Where: Ethereum Classic [Discord](https://discord.gg/hQs894U) `#ecips` channel. Will use/create a voice channel *ad hoc*.

## Agenda

### Quick client teams check-in

* Parity Tech
* ETC Core
* ChainSafe
* Multi-Geth

### Aztlán needs to be rejected as it's having multiple issues:

* [#217](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/217)
* [#226](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/226)
* [#227](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/227)

### Phoenix needs to be rejected as it's not of a sufficient patch especially with the context of the broken testnet activations:

* [#262](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/262)

### Testnet patch should be rejected to favor a clean new hardfork meta:

* [#293](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/293)
* [#297](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/297)

### It's still possible to do Phoenix on the same block number if we agree to activate one of the following options (ECIPs pending):

* Phoenix hardfork same as ETH Istanbul (including EIP-1884)
* Phoenix hardfork "classic flavor" (ECIP-1080 instead of 1884, EIP-1706 instead of EIP-2200)

### Anything else related to Aztlán and Phoenix

### Please comment to add items to the agenda.
