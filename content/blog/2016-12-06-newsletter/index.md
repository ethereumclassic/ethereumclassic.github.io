## ETC Development Report

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! Big shout out and many thanks to all the developers, miners, community members, user's and investors. This week's newsletter features some hints about a new team that will be joining the ETC community called "The Grothendieck Team". We are still keeping the monetary policy update from previous newsletters since it’s still the focus of many discussions throughout the community. We also have info about the upcoming ETC event in London, another article from Dr. Seberino and an article about governance models by Luis Molina. Thank you for taking the time to read and distribute this newsletter, looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

## The Grothendieck Team
IOHK is nearly finished with its vetting and onboarding process for the development team known as the "Grothendieck Team". The team has been named after Alexander Grothendieck, a German-born French mathematician who became the leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. They have been committed to Ethereum Classic by IOHK in order to build a Scala client for ETC based on IOHK's Scorex framework. An official announcement featuring the teams, background, past/current work experience, and bio will be posted in various channels. Plans are in place to bring the team on "Let's Talk ETC!" to discuss the roadmap and development timeframe for ETC in 2017, after they have had the chance to review all relevant ETC documentation properly. Links to the IOHK website, Scorex github, Let's Talk ETC youtube channel and ETC blog are posted below.

Also, we would love to know more about how the community would like to interact with and get reports from the new ETC developers. Please reply to this newsletter with ideas and requests for what you might like to see moving forward. You can also post your thoughts in this brainstorming thread from reddit.

## ETC Monetary Policy by Snaproll 
"ECIP-1017 proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model."

Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on the #monetary_policy channel on slack.

## "Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
