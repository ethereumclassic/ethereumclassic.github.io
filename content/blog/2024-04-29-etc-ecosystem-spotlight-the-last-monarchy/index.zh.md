In this ETC Ecosystem Spotlight we highlight the team behind the game "[The Last Monarchy](https://thelastmonarchy.io/)".

We spoke with Dominik Jurada and Sandro Licul, co-founders of The Last Monarchy about the following topics:

- What Is "The Last Monarchy"?
- Who are the team behind it?
- Why does it use ETC?
- The two function in the back end on ETC: NFTs and governance Token
- When is it going to be launched and on what platforms?
