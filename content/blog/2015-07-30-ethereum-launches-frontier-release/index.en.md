A few minutes ago, many of you generated and loaded the Ethereum Genesis block, marking the inception of Frontier, the first Live release of the Ethereum project.

The [Dev team](https://ethdev.com/) joins me in thanking each and everyone of you for your support during the past year and half. It’s incredible to see the progress that has taken place since that humble [first commit](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/commit/85aaddc694adc23ee56fce3d83a92a943a54b100) on Christmas Eve 2013. The vision of a censorship-proof ‘world computer’ that anyone can program, paying exclusively for what they use and nothing more, is now a reality.

Many of you will want to get started immediately. Please check out our [brand new website](https://www.ethereum.org/) for instructions on how to install and run the clients. If you face issues, the first port of call should be [our forums](http://forum.ethereum.org/). For more detailed information as to what this release includes, please see my previous [blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/27/final-steps/).

To celebrate the release, we’ll leave you with this new intro video to our project. We hope you enjoy it, and we cannot wait to see what you will build on Ethereum!
