### Checkpointing Presentation

IOHK (IOG) has released ECIP-1097 [#347](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/347) which covers their proposed "Checkpointing" system which aims to prevent 51% attacks on ETC. They'll explain the proposal and conduct a presentation, followed by a community Q&A.

### Goals

More details to come.
