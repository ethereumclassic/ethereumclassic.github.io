## ETC Development Report

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! Big shout out and many thanks to all the developers, community members, users and investors. The proposal originally submitted by Snaproll is now officially on [Github as ECIP-1017](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/20/files). We also have an [article](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/blog/2016-11-15-money-and-monetary-policy/) from Dr. Seberino discussing the basics of currency and monetary policy. Thank you for taking the time to read and distribute this newsletter, looking forward to your thoughts.

ETC Monetary Policy Proposal by @Snaproll is now officially out as ECIP-1017.

* "This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the networkâ€™s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model." 
* Please see his full post from [Github](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/20/files) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/5e5moq/etc_monetary_policy_proposal_by_snaproll_is_now/).
* Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on Slack in the #monetary_policy channel.

## "Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
