## **ETC Development Report**

Hi everyone, thank you for checking out this week's ETC newsletter! This is the first newsletter of 2017 and it’s looking like this year is going to be incredible. The blockchain bull is in full effect and as I’m writing this, the entire top 20 by market capitalization is in the green. Special thanks to all the developers, miners, user's, investors and other community members that made 2016 so special.

Featured in this week’s newsletter is the upcoming ["DieHard"](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v3.2.3) protocol upgrade which is going to occur at block 3,000,000 around ~Jan 15th. Thank you to everyone that contributed to ["DieHard"](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v3.2.3), nothing would be possible without all the hard work ETC devs put in. The protocol upgrade includes:

* Difficulty Bomb delay (ECIP-1010)
* EXP reprice (EIP-160)
* Replay Protection (EIP-155)

The other big story is the CEO of CoinBase (Brian Armstrong) is considering [the addition of ETC](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/816049577132310528).   Check out the post below to vote.

## **CEO of CoinBase BrianArmstrong considering adding ETC!**

Quote from Brian Armstrong below.

* "Yes - I'm thinking now that may have been a mistake. I'm not opposed to adding ETC if there is interest."

He also posted a poll for communities to let CoinBase know what currency they would like to see. Let him know you would like CoinBase to add ETC!

## **Trouble finding peers with Geth?**
Several ETC geth users reported problems connecting to peers after a fresh install. If your full node has trouble finding peers, you may want to try adding static peer file manually. An up-to-date list of ETC peers maintained by Epool can be found here:

* http://www1.epool.io/enodes.txt

This list of nodes should be added to ".ethereum/static-nodes.json".

## **Ethereum Classic is looking for Rust & JS developers.**

## **Let's talk ETC! Tuesdays at 7:30pm EST.**

Every Tuesday at 7:30pm EST we will be discussing what's going on in the ETC community and beyond. Last weeks show (12-20-16) features special guest Matt M aka "Snaproll" who is the creator of the monetary policy proposal featured in this newsletter. We will discuss monetary policy, ETC and blockchain in general. A link to the channel/show will be posted below, if you have ideas or questions please let us know. Thank you for subscribing to our latest updates and announcements!

## **ETC Monetary Policy** 

ETC Monetary Policy Proposal by @snaproll is now officially out as ECIP-1017

"This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time. In addition, this ECIP describes the requirements associated with maintaining this emission schedule through a potential change of the network’s consensus algorithm, from its current Ethash based Proof of Work to a possible POS or POW/POS hybrid model." Please see the full post from github and reddit at the links below.

Monetary policy discussions are still in progress on many platforms. However, most of the conversation seems to be taking place on the #monetary_policy channel on slack.

## **"Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.** 
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
