    description: Core-Geth is a distribution of go-ethereum with many flavors. For Thanos upgrade support, please use version v1.11.18 or later.

    description: Hyperledger Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases. For Thanos upgrade support, please use version 20.10.0 or later. Upgrade considerations, APIs between ParityEthereum and Besu significantly differ and mining is not very well supported in Besu at this moment. This client is Long Term Supported by the ChainSafe and ETC Cooperative teams as part of the Hyperledger project with stable funding from Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust. This is a recommended client from a well-known transparent team.
