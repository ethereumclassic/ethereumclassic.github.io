title: Clients
description: Download links for various Ethereum Classic clients and deployment tools
intro: Clients are used to sync with the Ethereum Classic network and verify blocks. Most users won't need to run a full node, but they allow those who do to trustlessly interact with the network. Ethereum Classic completed a network upgrade on June 1, 2020. Please update your node if you have not done so already. [Client Update Instructions](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2020-05-20-phoenix-hardfork).
