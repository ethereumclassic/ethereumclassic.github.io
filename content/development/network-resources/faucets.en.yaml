title: Faucets
description: Faucets are Ethereum Classic public services that allow you to obtain small amounts of testnet ETC for deploying contracts and testing transactions in a sandbox environment. If you're a developer, please consider contributing to these testnets by running nodes and mining on the networks. It's a selfless and charitable act for the greater Ethereum Classic ecosystem.
