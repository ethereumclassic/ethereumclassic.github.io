Ethereum Classic is something far more than just some lines of code.

Those lines of code that define the Ethereum Classic protocol have a magical property that, thanks to economic incentives and game theory, enable otherwise totally unrelated individuals to come together and organize far more effectively, peacefully and powerfully than any other organizational structure known today.

Limited not by geography, united in vision, and armed with the most powerful techno-socio-economic tools ever invented, they have the potential to revolutionize the world on a global scale.

Ethereum Classic does not just enable, but consists of its community; a highly decentralized, diverse, multi-talented and dedicated collection of individuals and groups from all over the planet. Their mission is to spread to good word of Classic and reinforce its pool of talent so that together, we can [upgrade](/why-classic/code-is-law) the systems of the world.
