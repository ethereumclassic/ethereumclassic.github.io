Ethereum foundation when [hardforked its blockchain](http://qz.com/730004/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ethereum-hard-fork/) broke vital values that could ultimately compromise forked Ethereum credibility.

As a consequence of that decision we ([Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org)), as a community, organized a movement to protect what is important for the future of society.

This movement gained [increadible traction](http://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-classic-overtakes-ripple-and-steem/) due to the philosophic allignment of many people with our [values proposition](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/33).

The community formed around these core values is so vibrating and captivating that investors were attracted as light to a nearby black hole resulting in one of the most proeminent blockchains in market capitalization and daily trade volume.

History will tell why these values are so important for an organization.
