# Who’s Talking at the [Classic Summit](https://etcsummit.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*3vCbXK5glCCkbEM0_XDfog.png)

First, a disclaimer, despite what you may think I have no inside information,
and honestly prefer the lack of hype to major hype. Major hype is unstable. So
get excited, but don’t get hyped.

## [Digital Currency Group (DCG)](http://dcg.co/)

Created the [Ethereum Classic Investment
Trust](https://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-investment-trust/) which brought
additional investment into Classic. They also created the [ETC
Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/) which is funding the summit and
seeking to fund other projects that improve the Classic ecosystem.

DCG will be represented by Barry Silbert (CEO), Meltem Demirrors (Director), and
Matthew Beck (Research Associate).

## [ETCDEV](https://www.etcdevteam.com/)

Has given us [geth for ETC](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum)
(after EF refused to support us), [Emerald
Wallet](https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet), two
[blockchain](http://gastracker.io/)
[explorers](https://github.com/ethereumproject/explorer), new [dev
tools](https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm), and lots more. They’ve got
a whole [roadmap](https://www.etcdevteam.com/roadmap.html) you can check out.

Four members of ETCDEV will be attending, [Igor
Artamonov](https://github.com/splix) (CTO), [Constantine
Kryvomaz](https://github.com/r8d8) (Rust Developer), and [Isaac
Ardis](https://github.com/whilei) (Go Developer), and Matt Mazur (Advisor) who
will be talking about the [ETC Monetary
Policy](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md).

## [Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK)](https://iohk.io/)

Is developing a new ETC node called Mantis, [formalized the EVM in
K](https://github.com/kframework/evm-semantics) (fancy maths; great for
Classic), gave us Let’s Talk ETC, and is [tying ETC
in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6scO_RMEgQ&feature=youtu.be) with their
Cardano platform.

IOHK is sending four employees, Charles Hoskinson (CEO), Christian Seberino
(Education), Alan McSherry (ETC Developer), and Alan Verbner (ETC Developer). A
couple of them have been on Let’s Talk ETC as well: [Charles on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4YjI6oYVY&index=7&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5)
and [Alan on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsUFzKoIW3I&index=8&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5).

## [Cody Burns](https://github.com/realcodywburns)

He’s worked on [Classic Ether
Wallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet/), proposed how we can
have [private addresses on
ETC](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/78), and wants to give us
[cross-chain atomic
swaps](https://medium.com/@DontPanicBurns/ethereum-cross-chain-atomic-swaps-5a91adca4f43).

## [Stewart Mackenzie](https://github.com/sjmackenzie)

Founded [Fractalide](http://fractalide.com/), a marketplace designed to make ETC
contracts easier to develop. [Stewart on Let’s Talk
ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-IL6-aXko&index=19&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqM444-qiILRDooRsvjV4_5).

## [Jihan Wu](https://twitter.com/jihanwu?lang=en)

He runs [Bitmain](http://bitmain.com/) and [Antpool](http://antpool.com/), the
largest Bitcoin mining pool.

*****

Anyway this is only about half of the attendees, there’s lots more miners,
exchange operators, developers attending and contributing to Classic. So again,
get excited, but don’t get hyped!
