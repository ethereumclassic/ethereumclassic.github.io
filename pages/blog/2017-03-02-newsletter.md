## **ETC Development Report**

Biggest story from the past week is a statement released in reference to [ETC monetary policy](https://www.etcdevteam.com/blog/articles/a-joint-statement-ecip1017.html). Additionally, since the community united and moved forward, Grayscale has announced that the [ETC Trust is a go](https://twitter.com/GrayscaleInvest/status/837649119992766465). March is shaping up to be an insanely great month for ETC and blockchain in general. Also in the news is a [new ETCdev Team website](https://www.etcdevteam.com/) that is up and running as well as another [weekly meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yegAaLdsWzg) from IOHK's Grothendieck team.

## **"Call To Action" still in effect. Looking for community contributions for the ETC Wikipedia page.** 
Reddit user "bitp" has brought it to the communities attention that the "Ethereum Classic" Wikipedia link currently redirects to "Ethereum". ETC community member /u/FaceDeer was previously a Wikipedia editor and has provided some insight on what should be done moving forward. One of his recommendations is that we start the process by adding to the Ethereum Classic section that is currently on the Ethereum Wikipedia page. ETC can then be given its own page after volunteers have submitted enough info. Please see his full post in the reddit thread linked below.
