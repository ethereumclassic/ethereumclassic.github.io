### Media Page - Third-Party Article Submission

If you're writing Ethereum Classic content, the [Media Kit](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/Media_Kit) repository holds an abundance of Ethereum Classic brand assets for content creators. Please pretty up those ETC articles with Ethereum Classic specific images, a lot of work went into all those graphics. If you're a graphic designer, please consider contributing to our branding by submitting content to the [Media Kit](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/Media_Kit) repository.

If you'd like to submit an Ethereum Classic related article to the website's Media section, please follow the instructions below.
