# Ethereum Classic Website

## Branches

* [Main website (master branch)](https://ethereumclassic.org/)
* [Preview (staging branch)](https://staging--ethereumclassic.netlify.com/)

Github pages is deployed in `master`; do not make commits to it directly.

To make content updates, push an update to the `source` branch. This will trigger Travis CI to create a new build in the `staging` branch.

The `staging` branch should then be used to create a PR into `master` (which is protected).
