In contrast, circular economy takes into consideration all possible dimensions related to a given activity. It is a multi-objective optimization process where every dimension is measured and controlled to achieve multiple positive outcomes. In that sense circular economy is more powerful and forward thinking than the former linear economy.\\nAn entity that seeks only to maximize the outcome in a single dimension is deemed to fail. The reason is dimensions reflect on each other. A person, for example, most likely won't be happy scoring greatly on spirituality and terribly on health, as the key for happiness is rather a balance on all dimensions. More happiness then boosts the positive outcome on every single dimension as a fortunate consequence. In this regard there is a clear indication that the investment done in the worst performing dimension has greater net impact.\\nThe circular economy development process involves accounting for all the relevant dimensions, simulating and taking action, and measuring impact. It is an iterative process where the outcome of the initial actions are translated into stronger actions able to drive greater impact next round. And naturally, as a consequence, compounded growth is achieved. In other words, circular economy's power lies in the potential multi dimensional controlled growth achieved with the application of its concepts.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Boosting circular economy to a whole new level\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Bitcoin divided the history in two, before and after, and has increadibly transformed the landscape in several relevant dimensions enabling one key pillar of the future society: \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"decentralized finance\"), \".\"), mdx(\"iframe\", {\n    width: \"1280\",\n    height: \"720\",\n    src: \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oeiOeDq_Nc\",\n    frameBorder: \"0\",\n    allowFullScreen: true\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oeiOeDq_Nc\"\n  }, \"The four pillars of a decentralized society | Johann Gevers | TEDxZug \"), \" from \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q\"\n  }, \"TEDx Talks\"), \" on \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    href: \"https://www.youtube.com/\"\n  }, \"YouTube\"), \".\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But there is a derived technology from Bitcoin that can have much greater impact on circular economy - Ethereum.

I don't mean here just the regular law as we know it, but the law as the universe knows it.\\nResearchers are constantly discovering new laws and relationships that rule the universe. With a better understanding of these laws, predictions of the future are more fit. Likewise circular economy researchers are finding new mechanisms that can be coded into laws, through smart contracts, to grow faster in a more predictable and sustainable way.\\nAs the scope of circular economy can be too wide to properly address all possible dimensions, breaking down social coins into categories is handy.
